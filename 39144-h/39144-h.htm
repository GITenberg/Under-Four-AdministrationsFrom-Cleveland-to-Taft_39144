<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>I am drawing these memories to a close in my log cabin
in the primitive Maine woods, where my wife and I
have been coming for rest and for fishing for the past
twenty years. Here we renew our youth, and far from
tumult and crowds, near to nature, we realize anew how
little is required in order to be contented and happy.
Here I am taken back to the memories of my childhood
in the little town in Georgia where too our home was a
log house, but for appearances had the luxurious outer
and inner dressing of clap-boarding painted white. The
logs of the upper story where we children played and slept
had no covering, which pleased us all the more.</p>

<p>In a highly organized society, we are often attracted
by pomp and circumstance, rather than by qualities of
heart and mind, which after all are the true measure of
enlightenment. Here in these woods, fair dealings and
human relations are not regulated by statutes, but by the
golden rule of conduct. We need not hide our possessions
behind locked doors, honesty is the accepted rule of life;
there are no treasures to hide and no bars to break.</p>

<p>It has been permitted me to do useful work and to
have interesting experiences. Privileged opportunities
have been afforded me for public service. Of these I
write.</p>

<p>Perhaps in chronicling the experiences of a life which
at many points touched vital affairs and the most interesting
personalities, I may be able to add something to
the record of men, movements, and events during those
decades still absorbing to us because they are so near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>The story is one of service at home and abroad, of
personal relations with six of our Presidents, with diplomats,
labor leaders, foreign rulers, leaders of industry,
and some plain unticketed citizens who were the salt of
the earth and certainly not the least of those whom it
was a pleasure to know.</p>

<p>To write of one's self requires a certain amount of
egotism. The autobiographer usually tries to justify this
vanity by explaining it as a desire to gratify his children
and kinsmen, or as a yielding to the urgent request of his
friends. Benjamin Franklin, whose autobiography, incomplete
though it be, is one of the most human in our
language, frankly conceded that he was prompted by the
weakness of praise. He says: "I may as well confess it,
since my denial of it will be believed by nobody, perhaps
I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity."</p>

<p>I do not wish to conceal from those who may from
interest or curiosity read what I write, that I am not
entirely free from that vanity, even though it be my chief
aim and purpose to cast some additional light upon our
country's development and upon events in which, in
public and private life, I have been permitted to take
part. Having held official positions at home and abroad
under four administrations, and having come in close
relationship with many of the statesmen and others of
distinction in this and foreign countries, perhaps my
narrative will serve to give more intimate knowledge and
truer appreciation of their personal traits and their exceptional
qualities.</p>

<p>I have also been influenced by a desire to bring a
message of encouragement to the youth of our country,
especially to those who may be conscious of handicaps
in the race, not to lose heart, but to be patient, considerate,
and tactful, and not to withhold the saving extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
ounce of effort which often spells the difference between
failure and success.</p>

<p>So long as our democracy remains true to its basic
principles and jealously guards the highways of opportunity,
the golden age will not be in the past, but ever in
the future. In externals the age in which we live has
changed, but the qualities of effort, of industry, and the
will to succeed which were required when I was a boy,
have not changed; they lead to the same goals now as
then, with this difference: that the boy of to-day has
greater advantages, better educational facilities, and
more avenues of advancement than the boy of two
generations ago. There never was a time in our history
when more men of humble origin have attained commanding
positions in industry, in commerce, and in
public affairs than now. While our American system is
not without fault, the fact that an enlightened public is
ever watchful to maintain our democratic principles and
to correct abuses is convincing proof of our country's
wholesome development in conformity with the changing
conditions of modern life.</p>

<p>I desire to make acknowledgment to my long-time and
esteemed friend, Mr. Lawrence Abbott, the President of
"The Outlook," who encouraged and advised me to
write these memoirs and even outlined the chapter plan
which I have largely followed.</p>

<p>My ancestors, on both my father's and my mother's side,
were natives of the Palatinate of Bavaria, of the town of
Otterberg and immediate vicinity. Up to the time of
Napoleon's taking possession of that part of the country
the Jews of the Palatinate had not adopted family
names. This they did later, beginning in 1808, when,
under Napoleon, the Palatinate became the Department
of Mont Tennérre and part of France. My great-grandfather,
for instance, before adopting the family name of
Straus, was known as Jacob Lazar, from Jacob ben
Lazarus, or Jacob son of Lazarus, as in biblical times.</p>

<p>Jacob Lazar, afterwards Jacob Straus, had three sons:
Jacob, Lazarus, and Salomon. My father, Lazarus
Straus, born April 25, 1809, was the son of the eldest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Jacob; and my mother, Sara Straus, born January 14,
1823, was the daughter of the youngest, Salomon. My
paternal grandfather died when my father was a young
man, but my grandfather Salomon Straus and his
brother Lazarus were known to us as children, particularly
to my eldest brother, Isidor, who knew them quite
well. They were men of culture and education, landowners
who sent their crops&mdash;mainly wheat, oats,
clover and clover seed&mdash;and those of their neighbors to
the markets of Kaiserslautern and Mannheim, the chief
commercial towns of the section. They spoke German
and French fluently, and had also, of course, been thoroughly
educated in the Hebrew language and literature.</p>

<p>The name of Straus was well known among the Jews
of Bavaria, and both my great-grandfather and my
father contributed to its prominence. During 1806 a
spirit of reaction, political and religious, swept over
France, making itself especially troublesome in Alsace
and in the German departments of the upper and lower
Rhine. Exceptionable and restrictive laws were advocated
to deprive the Jews there of rights they were enjoying
throughout France. As had happened often before,
and not unknown since, the reactionaries fanned the
hatred against Jews, making them the scapegoats in their
campaign against the advancing spirit of liberalism.
Thus the cause of the Jews was linked with the cause of
liberty itself.</p>

<p>Napoleon himself was at first prejudiced against the
Jews, regarding them as usurers and extortioners. He
soon realized, however, that the characteristics which
confronted him could not be imputed to Judaism, but
were due rather to the restricted civil and industrial
rights of the Jews and to their general unhappy condition.
It was made manifest to him that in Bordeaux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Marseilles, and the Italian cities of France, as well as in
Holland, some of the most useful and patriotic citizens
were Jews. Napoleon always had an eye on his historical
reputation, and desiring to do nothing that would obscure
his fame, he decided to convene a council of representative
Jews from the various provinces. Accordingly, on
May 30, 1806, he issued his decree, famous in the annals
of the Jews in modern times, summoning the Assembly
of Notables of the Jewish nation to meet in Paris the
following July. The prefects in the various provinces
were required to aid in the selection of the most distinguished
men from among the rabbis and the laity.</p>

<p>The deputies came to Paris from all parts of the
French Empire. They numbered one hundred and
eleven in all, and spoke French, German, and Italian.
Many of them were themselves well known, others
achieved a posthumous glamour in the deeds of descendants
who have since won distinction in European
history and in the annals of Jewry. There were Joseph
Sinzheim, first rabbi of Strasbourg, foremost Talmudist
and considered the most scholarly member of the Assembly,
who was made president of the Assembly and
later chairman of the Great Sanhedrin; Michel Berr,
afterwards the first French Jew to practice at the bar;
Abraham Furtado, son of a marano or crypto-Jewish Portuguese
family from which was also descended the wife
of the first Benjamin D'Israeli and Sir John Simon; Isaac
Samuel d'Avigdor of Nice, grandfather of Jules d'Avigdor

Israel Ottolenghi, an ancestor of Italy's late Minister of
War; Abraham de Cologna, rabbi of Mantua, a great
political leader and reformer; and many others of equal

to the world; and they assembled with a full consciousness
of their responsibility.</p>

<p>At this Assembly my great-grandfather represented
the Department of Mont Tennérre. He evidently played
an important part in the diplomacy which this unprecedented
council involved, for he was a member of the
sub-committee of fifteen delegated to meet the commissioners
appointed by Napoleon, also a member of the
committee to which the Assembly gave the delicate
work of preparing the groundwork for discussion with the
commissioners. Subsequently he was appointed to the
committee of nine of the Great Sanhedrin which the following
year presented to Napoleon's committee the conclusions
formulated and agreed upon by the Assembly,
and which helped to bring about their adoption.</p>

<p>My father, in turn, was active in the revolutionary
movement in 1848. This was an heroic effort on the part
of the liberal forces of Europe to achieve constitutional
government, and when it failed many of those who had
borne a conspicuous part fled to other countries. Thus
it was that Generals Sigel, Schurz, Stahl, and others,
who later were prominent in our Civil War, came to
America. These men and their immediate followers constitute
one of the most valuable groups of immigrants
that have come to these shores since our government was
organized. In the land of their birth they had already
made sacrifices for constitutionalism and democracy, and
basically they had made them for American principles.
They were Americans in spirit, therefore, even before
they arrived.</p>

<p>Having been active only locally in the revolutionary
movement, my father was not prosecuted. He was made
aware, however, of the suspicions of the authorities and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
was subjected to all those petty annoyances and discriminations
which a reactionary government never fails
to lay upon people who have revolted, and revolted in
vain. My father decided, in consequence, to emigrate.
This purpose he did not carry into effect until the spring
of 1852. He had many ties, which it was difficult to
break at once. He had been in comfortable circumstances,
like his father and grandfather a landowner and
dealer on a large scale in farm products, principally
grains. The revolution left him reduced in circumstances
and even to some extent in debt. He had four children,
of whom I was the youngest, being then less than a year
and a half old. Therefore, like the prudent man he was,
he waited, and then came to America alone with the
purpose of establishing himself in some small way before
allowing his family to exchange the comparative security
of their familiar surroundings for the insecurity of an
unknown land.</p>

<p>He landed at Philadelphia, where he met a number of
former acquaintances who had preceded him to America,
some of whom were already established in business. They
advised him to go South. Acting on this suggestion he
went on to Oglethorpe, Georgia, where he met some
more acquaintances from the old country. Through
them he made a connection with two brothers Kaufman,
who plied the peddler's trade. They owned a peddler's
wagon with which they dispensed through the several
counties of the State an assortment of dry goods and
what was known as "Yankee notions."</p>

<p>For my father this was indeed a pioneer business in a
pioneer country, yet it was not like the peddling of to-day.
In the fifties the population of the whole State of
Georgia was only about nine hundred thousand. Because
of the existence of slavery there were on the large plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
often more colored people than there were whites
living in the near-by villages. The itinerant merchant,
therefore, filled a real want, and his vocation was looked
upon as quite dignified. Indeed, he was treated by the
owners of the plantations with a spirit of equality that it
is hard to appreciate to-day. Then, too, the existence of
slavery drew a distinct line of demarcation between the
white and black races. This gave to the white visitor a
status of equality that probably otherwise he would not
have enjoyed to such a degree.</p>

<p>Provided only, therefore, that the peddler proved himself
an honorable, upright man, who conscientiously
treated his customers with fairness and made no misrepresentations
regarding his wares, he was treated as an
honored guest by the plantation owners&mdash;certainly a
spirit of true democracy. The visits were made periodically
and were quite looked forward to by the plantation
owners. The peddler usually stayed one night at the
house of his customer and took his meals with the family.
Another ideally democratic feature about these sojourns
was that spirit of Southern hospitality which, even in the
relationship between the wealthiest, most aristocratic
family and the humble peddler, permitted no pay for
board and lodging, and only a small charge for feed for
the horses. The peddler in turn usually made a gift to
either the lady or her daughter. Often he provided himself
with articles for this purpose, but usually on one
visit he would find out what might be welcome and on the
next visit bring it. The bonds of friendship thus made
are, I venture to say, hardly understandable in our day.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the course of these wanderings my father came to
Talbotton, a town of some eight or nine hundred inhabitants,
the county seat of Talbot County, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
forty miles east of the Alabama boundary. Talbotton
immediately impressed him so favorably that he selected
it as the next home for his family. It had an air of refinement
that pleased him; there were gardens with nicely
cultivated flowers and shrubbery, and houses that were
neat, well kept, and properly painted. Upon inquiry he
found further that there were splendid schools for both
boys and girls.</p>

<p>There was another factor which doubtless caused
father to be favorably impressed with Talbotton; it was
court week when he arrived, at which time a town has a
more or less festive appearance and is at its best so far as
activity is concerned. Then there was a third factor that
influenced him to settle there. Before doing business in
any county, peddlers were required to go to the county
seat to buy a license. At Talbotton this license was very
high, and my father doubted that his business in Talbot
County would warrant the expense. The idea occurred to
him to utilize the presence of the many strangers in town
to test the possibilities of the place by unpacking and
displaying his goods in a store. An interview with Captain
Curley, the only tailor in the town, developed the
fact that the store he occupied was too large for his needs
and he would be willing to share it with my father. So
this arrangement was promptly made, and at a cost less
than the expense of the county license for itinerant merchandising.</p>

<p>The experiment proved most satisfactory. In a few
weeks the stock was so depleted that my father proposed
to his partner that they rent a store and settle in Talbotton.
This they did. My father then prepared to go to
Philadelphia to get a stock of goods. His partner counseled
against this. There was a merchant in Oglethorpe
who, up to this point, had supplied them with all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
merchandise; they would need to refer to him for credit,
and they were still indebted to him for the stock in hand;
also, he would probably not approve of their settling
down in a store instead of peddling. The new store offered
large display space in comparison with the wagon,
and the partner doubted my father's ability to get
enough credit in Philadelphia to make a proper display.
Still another obstacle. The line of merchandise that was
to constitute most of their stock was what was then
known as dry goods and domestics. This business was
entirely in the hands of the Yankees and the most difficult
one in which to gain a foothold, especially for a
German immigrant without capital.</p>

<p>However, in the end my father did go to Philadelphia.
He had found several acquaintances in that city, as I
have already said, who had been resident in his neighborhood
in the old country. These people were established
in several of the wholesale houses in the different lines
of merchandise he required, except the dry goods. And
solely on the strength of his character and the reputation
he had had in Europe he was able to establish with them
the necessary credit, which neither his capital nor his
business experience in a new field and a strange country
warranted. In fact, their faith in him was so strong that
one of them gladly introduced him to the wholesale dry
goods merchants, and he was able to accomplish the full
purpose of his mission, to the great amazement of his
partner.</p>

<p>That was in 1853, and marked the beginning of my
family's history in this country. This bit of success
encouraged my father to write home that he might be
able to have us join him the following year. Accordingly,
on August 24, 1854, our little party left Otterberg. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was a journey that required no little courage and resourcefulness.
My mother had three years before suffered
a paralytic stroke, and of her four children the
eldest, my brother Isidor, was only nine years old. My
sister Hermina was a year and a half younger, Nathan
was six, and I was only three and a half. My mother's
father accompanied us from Otterberg to Kaiserslautern,
he on horseback and the rest of us with our nursemaid
in a carriage; we then took the train to Forbach, a French
frontier town, where we remained overnight. The next
morning we left for Paris. There we stayed until August
29th, when we started for Havre to board the steamer
St. Louis on her maiden voyage. As our boat was being
docked in New York on September 12th, my mother
recognized my father energetically pacing the wharf.
Minutes seemed like hours.</p>

<p>We did not go directly to Talbotton. Yellow fever
was raging in Savannah, and as we had to go through
that port <i>en route</i> to Talbotton, we waited in Philadelphia
for a few weeks, until the danger was considered
over. Even then we avoided entering the city until it
was time to board the train for Geneva, where we were to
take the stage-coach for the remaining seven miles to
Talbotton. The boat docked at Savannah in the morning,
and we spent the day until evening in the small
shanty that was called the station. When finally we
reached Talbotton we found a very comfortable home
ready for us. My precocious brother Isidor immediately
inspected the whole and thought it odd to be in a house
built on stilts, as he called it. The house, typical of that
locality, had no cellar, but was supported by an open
foundation of wooden pillars about twenty-five feet
apart.</p>

<p>Our family was received with kindness and hospitality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
so that in a very few years our parents were made to feel
much at home. My mother, who had considerable experience
in the cultivation of flowers and vegetables, soon
had a garden which was very helpful and instructive to
her circle of neighbors and friends. My father, always a
student and well versed in biblical literature and the
Bible, which he read in the original, was much sought by
the ministers of the various denominations, several of
whom habitually dined at our house when in Talbotton
on their circuit. At such times the discussion usually ran
along theological lines. One of my earliest recollections is
hearing my father take passages from the Old Testament
and translate them literally for the information of these
ministers.</p>

<p>We were the only Jewish family in the town. This at
first aroused some curiosity among those who had never
met persons of our race or religion before. I remember
hearing some one doubt that we were Jews and remarking
to my father, who had very blond hair and blue eyes,
that he thought all Jews had black hair and dark complexion.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>My brother Isidor and my sister were immediately
sent to school, and my second brother and I were sent as
soon as we arrived at school age. I was seven years old
when I began learning my letters.</p>

<p>My main religious instruction came from conversations
with my father and from the discussions the ministers
of various denominations had with him, which I always
followed with great interest. When my brother Nathan
and I were respectively about eleven and eight and a half
years old, we were sent to the Baptist Sunday school
upon the persuasion of the Baptist minister, who had
become an intimate friend of my father's. There we heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the Bible read and were taught principally from the Old
Testament. Our teacher was a gunsmith who had more
piety than knowledge, and what he lacked in erudition he
made up by good intentions which, after all, had a cultural
value. We continued our attendance some two years.</p>

<p>At eleven I entered Collinsworth Institute, a higher
school for boys, about a mile outside of Talbotton. Isidor
had been there, and Nathan was there then. It was not
a large school, though it was the best of its kind in our
vicinity. The recitation hall or chapel was a little frame
building standing in a square, and around that were eight
or ten one-story frame houses where boys coming from a
distance lived. The pupils ranged in age from about ten
to eighteen, and there were three teachers. We were
taught the three R's, and the advanced pupils studied
the classics.</p>

<p>In our small town, being the county seat, we had gala
days each month when the court convened and people
came from the surrounding districts as for a holiday.
There was much drinking of gin and whiskey by the
young country squires, which frequently ended up in
some fighting where pistols and knives were freely used.
This all left a deep impression on my young mind and
made me a prohibitionist long before I knew the meaning
of the word. In the North when boys got to fighting they
used their fists; in the South they used, besides their
fists, sticks and stones, and consequently it was a more
serious and dangerous affair. If in the North one boy
cursed another or called him a liar, it would not necessarily
lead to a fist fight; in fact, it usually stopped at recrimination.
In the South that kind of quarreling meant a
serious fight. I think because of these facts the Southern
boys were much more guarded and polite to each other in
speech than was customary among Northern boys. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
much of the so-called Southern politeness had its
roots in the use, in boyhood, of milder terms in case of
disagreement. I recall one fight between two of the leading
men of Talbotton, both deacons in the same church.
One took out his pocket knife and cut the other's throat,
and he died. After considerable delay the murderer was
tried, but because of his high standing in the community
he was acquitted, doubtless on the plea of self-defense,
and he got off scot-free.</p>

<p>As a boy brought up in the South I never questioned
the rights or wrongs of slavery. Its existence I regarded
as matter of course, as most other customs or institutions.
The grown people of the South, whatever they thought
about it, would not, except in rare instances, speak
against it; and even then in the most private and guarded
manner. To do otherwise would subject one to social
ostracism. We heard it defended in the pulpit and justified
on biblical grounds by leading ministers. With my
father it was different. I frequently heard him discuss
the subject with the ministers who came to our house,
and he would point out to them that the Bible must be
read with discrimination and in relation to the period to
which the chapters refer; and it must not be forgotten
that it is the history of a people covering more than a
thousand years; and that even then there had been no
such thing as perpetual bondage, as all slaves were declared
free in the year of jubilee.</p>

<span class="caption">OSCAR S. STRAUS AT SIX</span>
</div>

<p>Looking backward and making comparisons between
my observations as a boy in the South and later in the
North, I find there was much more freedom of expression
in the North than in the South. Few people in the South
would venture to express themselves against the current
of dominant opinion upon matters of sectional importance.
The institution of slavery with all that it implied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seemed to have had the effect of enslaving, or, to use a
milder term, checking, freedom of expression on the part
of the master class only in lesser degree than among the
slaves themselves.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In our town, as in all Southern communities, the
better families were kind, especially to their household
slaves, whom they regarded as members of the family
requiring guardianship and protection, in a degree as
if they were children. And the slaves addressed their
masters by their first names and their mistresses as
"miss." My mother, for instance, was "Miss Sara." I
recall one of our servants pleading with my mother:
"Miss Sara, won't you buy me, I want to stay here. I
love you and the white folks here, and I am afraid my
master will hire me out or sell me to some one else." At
that time we hired our servants from their masters,
whom we paid an agreed price. But as the result of
such constant pleadings my father purchased household
slaves one by one from their masters, although neither
he nor my mother believed in slavery. If we children
spoke to the slaves harshly or disregarded their feelings,
we were promptly checked and reprimanded by our
parents. My father also saw to it that our two men
servants learned a trade; the one learned tailoring and the
other how to make shoes, though it was regarded disloyal,
at any rate looked upon with suspicion, if a master
permitted a slave boy or girl to be taught even reading
and writing. When later we came North we took with us
the two youngest servants, one a boy about my age, and
the other a girl a little older. They were too young to
look out for themselves, and so far as they knew they
had no relatives. We kept them with us until they grew
up and could look out for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>The people throughout the South, with the exception
of the richer plantation owners, lived simply. In our
household, for instance, we always lived well, but economically.
My mother was very systematic and frugal.
She had an allowance of twenty dollars a month, and
my brother Isidor has well said that she would have
managed to save something even if it had been smaller.
It was her pleasure to be her own financier, and small as
her allowance sounds now, she was able in the course of
two or three years to save enough to buy a piano for my
sister. This she felt to be an expense with which my
father's exchequer should not be taxed.</p>

<p>We raised our own vegetables and chickens. Fresh
meat, except pork, might have been termed a luxury.
Many of the families had their own smokehouses, as we
did, which were filled once a year, at the hog-killing
season. There was no such thing as a butcher in our
little town. When a farmer in the country round wanted
to slaughter an ox or a sheep, he would do so and bring
it to town, exhibit it in the public square in a shanty
called the market (used for that particular occasion and
at other times empty), toll the bell that was there, and in
that way announce that some fresh meat was on sale.
This procedure never occurred oftener than once in two
or three weeks during the cold weather.</p>

<p>Ice was another luxury in that community. It had to
be shipped many miles and was therefore brought in only
occasionally, mainly for a confectioner who at times offered
ice cream to the people.</p>

<p>There was no gas lighting. Oil lamps were used, but
to a larger extent candles, which were manufactured in
each household, of fat and bees' wax. In that process we
children all helped.</p>

<p>Indeed, with a small business in a small town in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
days it was possible for a man to accumulate a surplus
only through the practice of the strictest economy by his
family as well as by himself, an economy almost bordering
parsimony. There were no public or free schools in
that part of the South; every textbook had to be bought
and tuition paid for; and there were four of us.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When the war broke out new economies were called
for. A simple life has its advantages; it is conducive to
self-help, also to the ability to do without things and
meet emergencies without unhappiness. My father's
partner joined the Fourth Georgia Regiment, and my
brother Isidor, then sixteen, was withdrawn from Collinsworth
Institute to take up work with my father. He
had gained some experience in carrying on the business
by helping father evenings, for our store was open until
nine-thirty. It was closed during the supper hour, but
reopened thereafter.</p>

<p>In that part of the country coffee became unobtainable
except when now and then a few bags arrived on a ship
that had run the blockade. Our mothers learned to give
us an acceptable substitute by cutting sweet potatoes
into little cubes, drying them in the sun, then roasting
and grinding them, together with grains of wheat, like
the ordinary bean. This made a hot and palatable drink
having the color of coffee without the harmful stimulus
of its caffeine.</p>

<p>Salt also became scarce. It was difficult and at times
impossible to obtain enough to cure our pork. Some one
discovered that the earthen floors of the smokehouses
were impregnated with considerable salt from previous
curings, so a method was invented for recovering it from
that source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>In the later years of the war, when railway transportation
was very poor and in many localities interrupted,
we did not suffer for food, because, as I have said,
most households in the small towns and in the country
raised the major part of their food supplies; they had their
own chickens, eggs, milk, butter, garden provisions.
Children of my age lived largely on corn bread and
molasses, of which there was an ever-plentiful amount.</p>

<p>During the second year of the war my father's partner
was discharged from his regiment for physical disability.
My father, always insistent upon the best possible education
for us all, therefore urged my brother Isidor to continue
his studies. Most of the high schools and colleges,
however, had been suspended because the teachers, as
well as many of the senior scholars, had joined the army.
On the other hand, the war had fired the whole South
with the military spirit, and as was natural for a young
man barely seventeen, my brother chose to attend the
Georgia Military Academy at Marietta, which was running
full blast. Earlier in the war, when the Fourth
Georgia Regiment, taking practically all the able-bodied
men of the town, had left for the front, the boys of Talbotton
organized a company of which Isidor was elected
first lieutenant. They had offered their services to the
governor of the State, but he replied that there were not
enough arms to equip all the men, so that equipping boys
was out of the question. All these incidents had influenced
my brother in his choice, and he left quite enthusiastically
for the Georgia Military Academy to take his
entrance examinations. When he returned, however, his
mood was much different. Upon his arrival at Marietta
he had about an hour's waiting before he could see the
proper person. Some acquaintances whom he met on the
campus invited him to visit their living quarters meanwhile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
As he entered one of the rooms the door stood
ajar. Without noticing this he gave the door a push, resulting
in his being drenched to the skin by a bucket of
water that had been balanced over the door and held
there by the position of the door when ajar. He had to
return to the hotel to change his entire apparel. He had
not heard of hazing before, and the incident disgusted
him so that he never returned to the academy. He embarked
upon his career as a merchant the very next
morning.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In 1863 our family moved to Columbus, Georgia. It
was a much larger place than Talbotton, having a population
of about twelve thousand, offered more opportunities,
and, too, my brother Isidor had already found employment
there. With its broad main street and brick
residences it looked like a great city to me.</p>

<p>As in Talbotton, there were no public schools in
Columbus, so I was sent to a private school kept by an
Irish master named Flynn, who did not act on the pedagogical
principle, "Spare the rod and spoil the child."
By him I was taught the three R's and began Latin. I
also experienced my first stage-fright at Master Flynn's,
when my turn came to speak a piece before the entire
school. In all Southern schools much emphasis was
placed upon elocution. I well remember practicing before
a mirror and reciting under the trees in stentorian
voice with dramatic gesture the great oration put into
John Adams's mouth by Daniel Webster, beginning:
"Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my
hand and my heart to this vote."</p>

<p>After another year this school was discontinued and I
was sent to one kept by a Dr. Dews. He was a teacher
trained in the classics and far less severe than Flynn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
more sympathetic and cultured. Under him I began
Virgil and afterwards Horace. It was not customary to
teach English grammar; we derived that from our laborious
drilling in Latin grammar.</p>

<p>There were no public libraries, and few families, other
than those of professional men, had many books. The
standard assortment consisted of the Bible, Josephus,
Burns; some had Shakespeare's works. I do not recall
at this period reading any book outside of those we had
for study at school. Boys of my age led an outdoor life,
indulging in seasonable sports which rotated from top-spinning
to marbles, to ball-playing, principally a game
called town-ball. We all had shot-guns, so that in season
and out we went bird-hunting and rabbit-hunting.</p>

<p>We went barefooted nine months of the year, both for
comfort and economy. As in Talbotton we lived most
economically. We were not poor in the sense of being
needy; we never felt in any way dependent. Our home
was comfortable, wholesome, full of sunshine and good
cheer, and always hospitable to friends. Our wants were
few and simple, so we had plenty, and I felt as independent
as any child of the rich.</p>

<p>We were now in the midst of the Civil War, and
money, measured in gold, was worth about five cents per
dollar. My brother Nathan seemed to be affected by this
into constant scheming for making pocket money. He
was fifteen years old, and out of school hours helped
father in the store; but he seemed to be in need of more
pin-money. He finally hit on a plan that proved quite
lucrative. He collected or bought up pieces of hemp rope
and sold them to a manufacturer. Hemp was very scarce
and much needed. With the proceeds he bought a beautiful
bay pony, which he and I prized more than any possession
we have ever had, before or since.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>On the 16th of April, 1865, after a feeble skirmish on
the part of the citizen soldiers, mainly superannuated
men and schoolboys, Columbus was captured by General
James H. Wilson at the head of a cavalry corps of fifteen
thousand men. The war had practically ended seven days
before, as Lee surrendered on the 9th at Appomattox
Court House in Virginia; but as telegraph and railroad
communication had been disrupted, this fact was not yet
known in our part of Georgia. As soon as Wilson's army
took possession of our debilitated city general confusion
reigned. Looting began by the town rabble, led
by several drunken Federal soldiers; cotton warehouses
were burned, the contents of which represented the savings
of many, including most of my father's; all horses
were seized, and among them our little pony, which I
never saw again, though I still retain a vivid picture of
him in my mind's eye. Frequently since, when I have
met that fine and accomplished old veteran, General
Wilson, who is still among the living, hale and hearty, I
have jestingly reproached him for taking from me the
most treasured possession I ever had.</p>

<p>This incident and others served to give me a most
vivid impression of the closing years of the Civil War.
Another very vivid impression that occurred shortly
before the beginning of the war clings to my memory.
Robert Toombs, one of Georgia's most conspicuous
United States Senators, was making a speech at the
Masonic Temple in Columbus, Georgia. It was a hot
summer day. Toombs was a short, thick, heavy-set man
of the Websterian type, and one of the South's most
picturesque orators. After the election of Lincoln, however,
Toombs advocated secession and resigned from the
Senate, was talked of for the Confederate presidency, did
become Confederate Secretary of State, and was later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
commissioned a brigadier-general, and commanded with
distinction in numerous battles of the Civil War. During
the speech I heard him make, he drew a large white handkerchief
from his pocket with a flourish, and pausing
before mopping his perspiring forehead, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The Yankees will not and can not fight! I will guarantee
to wipe up with this handkerchief every drop of
blood that is spilt."</p>

<p>Neither he nor the audience foresaw what was coming.
The Civil War was a family affair, yet the hostility it
engendered and the misconception it brought in its train
regarding the valor, and even the standards of civilization,
of the enemy, were as extreme and virulent as in a war
between nations of different continents and races. Such
are the brutalizing passions war arouses in banishing
from the individual mind the most elementary ideas of
brotherhood.</p>

<p>When the war ended my father had to begin life anew,
and because of the discouraging prospects and conditions
of the South he decided to move North. In the North,
too, he could more readily dispose of the remainder of his
cotton, his chief asset, to pay off debts which he owed in
New York and Philadelphia for goods purchased before
the war. With the few thousand dollars remaining after
paying these debts, and with good credit, he thought he
could begin some new business in a small way.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with our arrival in Philadelphia my
brother Isidor arrived in New York from Europe, where
he had gone two years before as secretary of a commission
to buy supplies for the State of Georgia. The blockade
of the Southern ports became so effective that ships
could not get through, so that he did not succeed in getting
over the supplies; but he made several thousand
dollars in the sale of Confederate bonds. Upon learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in New York that we were in Philadelphia, he immediately
came there to find out my father's plans. He persuaded
father that New York, as the chief market, was
preferable to Philadelphia as a secondary one. Consequently
we moved to New York, and father and Isidor,
together with Nathan, planned to establish themselves
in the wholesale crockery business. Isidor, twenty years
old, first used part of his fortune to buy for my mother a
high-stoop, three-story brick house at 220 West Forty-Ninth
Street, now long since torn down, but which we
occupied for over eighteen years.</p>

<p>It was fully six months before the new business venture
was launched. My father depended for his part of the
capital upon the sale of the remainder of his cotton,
which had been shipped to Liverpool, and this was not
effected until early in 1866. In the intervening months he
visited his creditors in New York to arrange for paying his
debts. In this connection I remember one significant
incident: His principal New York creditor was the dry
goods house of George Bliss &amp; Co., to whom he owed an
amount between four and five thousand dollars. (Bliss
afterward became a member of the banking firm of
Morton, Bliss &amp; Co.) When he called regarding the payment
of this, Mr. Bliss asked how old he was, what
family he had, and what he intended doing. My father
answered that he was fifty-seven, that he had a wife and
four children, and that he hoped to make a new start in
the wholesale crockery business. "I don't think you are
fair to your family and yourself," said Mr. Bliss, "to
deprive yourself of the slender means you tell me you
possess by paying out your available resources. I will
compromise with you for less than the full amount in view
of the hardships of the war and your family obligations."</p>

<p>My father had a very high sense of honor and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
always more concerned in maintaining it beyond possible
reproach than in making money. Some parents
forget that they cannot successfully live by one standard
outside and another inside the home, and many never
realize that children are influenced not so much by the
preaching as by the true and real spirit of their parents.
My father believed that "a good name is better than
riches," and within the home or without he lived up to
that standard. I clearly remember the impression I received
of his integrity at the time of this Bliss incident,
and of a certain feeling of compunction on the part of his
creditor, as though he had expected something different.
Most Southern merchants regarded themselves morally
freed from paying Northern creditors because the Confederate
government had confiscated such debts and compelled
the debtors to pay the amounts to the government.
But my father held true to his standard, and I well remember
his parting words to Bliss that day: "I propose
to pay my debts in full and leave to my children a good
name even if I should leave them nothing else."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>My brother Isidor, always my guide, philosopher, and
friend, now arranged for my schooling. In my geography
textbook was a picture of Columbia College, and I had
the fixed idea that when we came to New York I wanted
to go there. On inquiry we learned that I was too young,
for I was only fourteen and a half, and that I had not the
requirements for admission. So in the autumn of 1865
Isidor had me enter Columbia Grammar School, then one
of the best schools in the city. It was my first experience
in a really first-rate school, and the teaching was so much
more thorough and exact than my previous training had
been that it seemed to me I had to learn everything anew.
The tuition fee and the cost of books was considerable, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
view of the modest income of the family; but my father,
economical in all other respects, was liberal beyond his
means where the education of his children was concerned.
My brother, moreover, was desirous that I should have
the advantages of the college training which circumstances,
notably the war, had withheld from him.</p>

<p>I appreciated to the full the privileges I was permitted
to enjoy and studied with all my might. The school
regulations required that parents fill out a blank each
week stating, among other things, the number of hours
we studied at home. The average number of hours daily
reported were three or four, and as my record was fully
double that, I felt rather ashamed to give the true
number, so I always gave less. The school was on
Fourth Avenue and Twenty-Seventh Street, and our
home on Forty-Ninth Street was near Eighth Avenue. I
invariably walked both ways, saving car fares and at the
same time conserving my health, for aside from a half-hour
of gymnastics twice a week in school I had neither
time nor opportunity otherwise to get the exercise my
body required.</p>

<p>Owing to the careless preparation I had received at the
schools in the South, I made a poor showing in spite of
my hard work now, though on one occasion I shone with
accidental glory. It was the custom for the instructor to
put the same question to pupil after pupil, and to elevate
the one who gave the correct answer to the head of the
class. In this instance, it so happened that I gave the
fortunate answer and thus qualified for the seat of scholastic
eminence. As I sat there enjoying a near view of
the teacher's countenance, I wondered how long I should
remain thus distinguished, and was unable to resist the
impulse to cast an occasional backward glance at the
rows of seats in the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>At about this time, an elderly gentleman of distinguished
appearance entered the classroom. He was
S. F. B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph. Morse, whose
grandson was in my class, knowing the custom and observing
me in the seat of honor, complimented me. He
observed that I, like himself, had a large head in comparison
with the body, and remarked that I must be a
bright boy. But I felt embarrassed rather than gratified
at the praise, for I knew, and so did the rest, that I did
not deserve it. I still recall that scene, and see the venerable
old man, then seventy-five years old, with the long
white beard that made him look even older.</p>

<p>When the time came, in the spring of 1867, for our
class to go up for college examination, the Rev. Dr.
Bacon, successor as principal of the school to Charles
Anthon, the distinguished classical scholar and editor of
classical works, called the boys of our class before him
and gave us each a blessing with some encouraging words.
When my turn came he was very kind, telling me he
knew I had tried hard, but because of my early training,
or lack of it, he feared I might not pass. I saw my
chances of a college education go glimmering. There
were, however, still two weeks before the examinations,
and I determined to use those for all they were worth.
I worked night and day, cramming with a vengeance.
I felt I could not expect my father to keep me in school
another year when after two years of preparation I had
shown myself so deficient. That thought was my spur,
though in point of fact I am sure both my brother Isidor
and my father, realizing I had done the best I could,
would have insisted upon my taking another year for
preparation.</p>

<p>The result of my entrance examinations was more
favorable than I could have hoped. It turned out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
I was the only one from our grammar school class to pass
in all subjects without a single condition. It was luck
rather than brilliancy. The professor who examined my
classmates in ancient geography, being the author of
the book upon which the examination was held, was so
meticulous that unless the student gave the answer
exactly as in the book he was marked deficient. By the
time it came my turn to be examined another and more
generous-minded professor had taken his place and
passed me with the highest mark. The others, who had
all flunked, regarded me, in their own language, as "the
lucky dog."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>My college course began on October 7, 1867. Here I
did not find the studies hard. I had ample leisure for
reading and took full advantage of the college library,
from which we were free to select and take home whatever
books we desired. Then, as now, I cared little for fiction.
To me the literature of facts was more interesting and
therefore lighter reading, and I read much biography and
history.</p>

<p>Our class matriculated fifty-two, but dwindled down
to thirty-one by graduation. In the class were Brander
Matthews, now professor of literature at Columbia as
well as literary and dramatic critic; Robert Fulton Cutting,
financier and ideal citizen, descendant of an old and
famous New York family, as his name indicates; Stuyvesant
Fish, banker, also of a well-known New York
family, whose father, Hamilton Fish, was Secretary of
State in the Grant Cabinet, and whose grandfather and
father both were among Columbia alumni; and Henry
Van Rensselaer, who became a Jesuit father and is now
no longer among the living.</p>

<p>At the commemoration of the one hundred and fiftieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
anniversary of the founding of the college three of us&mdash;Robert
Fulton Cutting, Brander Matthews, and myself&mdash;received
the honorary degree of LL.D. At this writing,
fifty years after graduation, there are but ten of us
remaining.</p>

<p>The most coveted honors in those days were to be had
for literary achievement and class rank. Among the
few prizes was one known as the Alumni Prize, awarded
to the most deserving student in the graduating class.
The college board nominated for that honor William
Henry Sage, now our class historian, Joseph Fenelon
Vermilye, and myself; and the class elected Vermilye for
the prize.</p>

<p>Athletics had not attained the vogue it has in American
universities to-day, and was particularly absent in our
college, confined then to a city block. Doubtless due to
this lack the boys of our class, on the whole a spirited and
boisterous lot, found self-expression in a disregard for
proper decorum in the lecture rooms. There was one period
where this was conspicuously the case. The subject
was Evidences of Christianity. It was compulsory and
along denominational lines. It did not interest many of
the boys, and some of those who were not Episcopalians
even resented it; to boot, the professor, Rev. Dr. McVickar,
was a mild-mannered man, entirely unable to
maintain discipline. The result was frequent and various
disturbances during the sessions of his class, which often
put the good-natured and unsophisticated man at his
wits' end. He complained to the college board, and
President Barnard took the matter up with some seriousness,
but no real appeasement.</p>

<p>I felt great sympathy for Dr. McVickar, for he was
earnest and gentle, and took much to heart the conduct
of the men in his class. Of course, in common with most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of my classmates I strongly favored that the subject be
elective instead of compulsory; yet I realized that, as
colleges were then constituted, the original Columbia
being largely an Episcopalian foundation, there was a
legal right, as distinguished from reason, for the requirement
that the course in Evidences of Christianity be compulsory.</p>

<p>One day when the disturbances became most flagrant,
and the poor professor was really quite helpless, I ventured
to point out to him how he might bring about
order. He received my suggestion most favorably, so I
asked him to let me take his chair for a few moments. I
made a brief appeal to the class, reminding them that we
were now seniors, and that there were some, especially
those intending to study for the ministry, who were
interested in the subject and prevented from following it
by the boisterous behavior of the rest. I was jeeringly
dubbed Professor Straus, but I went right on. I said I
knew there were a number who were opposed to the
study of Evidences of Christianity, and I proposed that
they rise. To those who got up I gave permission to
leave the room, and as I recall it, there were some eight
or ten left. Then I turned to Dr. McVickar and said,
"Here is a class you can teach." And the session went on
smoothly enough. Subsequently a petition was drawn
up and signed by a large majority of the class, asking
that we be excused from examinations in this particular
subject; but President Barnard replied that the request
could not be entertained.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the whole my four years at college were full of
serious effort and not altogether free from anxiety. I had
a restless ambition to have a useful career and it seemed
difficult to discover for what I was best fitted. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
while, in those dreamy days, I even believed I might
achieve some measure of success as a poet. I recall with
a smile that the choice for class poet at commencement
lay between Brander Matthews, whom we then knew as
James Brander Matthews, and myself. And for some
reason, which posterity will doubtless find even more
difficult to fathom than I have, I was chosen. Matthews
had already given evidence of his literary talents; he contributed
much to the college papers, and wrote humorous
poems. However, at our graduation exercises held
in the Academy of Music, Fourteenth Street and Irving
Place, the city's largest auditorium then, my class poem
was well received by a capacity audience of proud parents
and sympathetic friends. I had gravely entitled it
"Truth and Error."</p>

<p>A more fervent aspiration held by me in those years
was to devote my life to the nation, and I could conceive
no better way of doing so than to enter the army. One
day I saw an item in the press that President Grant had
several appointments to make to the United States
Military Academy. I consulted with Dr. F. A. P. Barnard,
president of Columbia, and he gave me a letter of
introduction to Grant, highly commending me for an
appointment. When President Grant came to New
York I called on him. He received me very kindly, but
informed me that he had only something like eight appointments
allowed him by law, and he had decided to
give them where possible to the sons of officers who had
been killed in the war; if, however, there were not enough
such candidates he would be glad to give me a chance.
I told him I thoroughly agreed that his decision was so
appropriate that I would not even ask to be appointed
under the circumstances.</p>

</div>

<p>During the second half of my senior year I finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
chose the law as my vocation. I preferred it to a business
career because I disliked the idea of devoting my life
to mere money-making, as business appeared to me then.
My outlook was idealistic rather than practical, and to
harmonize it with the workaday world caused me much
mental anguish and struggle, as it does many a young
man, even where affluent fortune has smiled. However,
my father and brother had begun to prosper and had no
need for my coöperation unless on my own account I
chose to join them. Besides, I was the youngest and had
the benefit of the brotherly interest and economic protection
of Isidor and Nathan, should I need it. This gave
me a feeling of security, and encouraged me to put forth
my best efforts not only to succeed for myself, but to
show my appreciation to them. Where, under moderate
circumstances, a family puts forth coöperative effort in
making its way forward, closer family ties result, with the
advantages of stimulating unselfishness and common
devotion, which in turn promote a happiness that members
of richer families often miss because of their more
independent relations.</p>

<p>So I prepared to enter Columbia Law School in the
fall of 1871. Meanwhile that summer I took my first
vacation since coming to New York. I went to Wyoming
Valley, near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where I had a
good time despite the farmer with whom I boarded.
Perhaps I had no right to expect much for the five dollars
a week I paid him; but whatever I expected I know I got
less. However, there were fish in the brooks and I do not
recall that I starved. I had spent other summers assisting
in some branch of my father's business, not because I
relished work unduly, but because I regarded it less as
labor than as diversion. It was interesting and useful
activity which gave me an understanding of business that
was valuable later in following my chosen profession.</p>

<p>Columbia Law School in 1871 was at Lafayette Place.
The course covered two years, at the end of which a successful
examination entitled a student to admission to
the bar without a further State examination, and for
those who gave serious attention to the course it was an
easy matter to pass this finishing examination.</p>

<p>Particularly worthy of mention with regard to the
school are Professors Theodore W. Dwight and Francis
Lieber. Professor Dwight, the able director of the school
at that time, well deserved his great reputation as the
most distinguished teacher of law in the country. He
was not only a master of his subject, but had a marvelous
gift for imparting his great knowledge.</p>

<p>Professor Lieber, whose lectures we attended once a
week, taught us political science. He was a Prussian
veteran who fought in the Battle of Waterloo. At the
close of the Napoleonic Wars he had returned to his
studies in Berlin, and thereafter was arrested several
times for his outspoken liberal views. After frequent
persecution and even imprisonment, he fled to England,
and in 1827 came to America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>He was author of many books on legal and political
matters, among them "Civil Liberty and Self-Government,"
which was adopted as a textbook in several of our
universities. In 1863 he prepared "Instructions for the
Government of Armies of the United States, in the
Field," which Lincoln promulgated as Order No. 100 of
the War Department. It was a masterly piece of work,
embodying advanced humanitarian principles, and it
later formed the basis of several European codes.</p>

<p>As a rule, egotism and real merit negate one another
rather than coördinate; Lieber was the exception. He
had both, and combined them to a marked degree, sometimes
in a manner that afforded amusement to his students.
For instance, he referred continuously to "my
Civil Liberty" as a book of extraordinary erudition, new
in its field and the last word on the matter. He was so
full of his subject that he was apt to lose himself and
stray off, with his distinctly German accent, into the
vast field of his profound philosophical and historical
knowledge. A veritable encyclopædia of information, he
was really more of an expounder than a teacher. As his
course was optional, those who came to listen came to
learn, and we received a larger view of the function of
law in civil society than we derived from all our studies
of municipal law.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I was graduated from law school in June, 1873, and
immediately entered the offices of Ward, Jones &amp; Whitehead,
one of New York's prominent firms. John E. Ward,
the senior member, who presided over the Democratic
National Convention that nominated Buchanan, and
later served for two or three years as Minister to China,
was a friend of my brother's, and he took me into his
office largely out of friendship for Isidor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>I remained with this firm only a few months. Later in
1873 I formed a partnership with James A. Hudson, a
man about ten years older than I, who had also been
associated with the Ward firm. As Hudson &amp; Straus we
opened offices on the fourth floor of 59 Wall Street.</p>

<p>On the same floor in this building was the office of
Charles O'Conor, then the acknowledged head of the
American Bar. He had practically retired, but retained
a small office of one or two rooms, with one clerk. He
came in only two or three times a week. Often when he
felt fatigued he would rest on a lounge in a room set apart
as library in our office. For a young lawyer like myself it
was an unusual privilege to have such pleasant personal
relations with so able and wise a leader in the profession.
Incidentally I think O'Conor was instrumental in sending
us our first important case, the collection of an old debt
of considerable size. We were so successful for our client
that, of his own accord, he sent us a check for ten thousand
dollars, saying he would make it larger if we regarded
it insufficient. The fact was, the amount was
larger than we had thought of charging, and we frankly
told him so. With five thousand dollars in reserve I felt
rich and independent. My wants were naturally simple
and our general practice was encouraging.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At about this time I first became active in public-spirited
undertakings. The Young Men's Christian
Association a few years before had opened its Twenty-Third
Street Branch at the corner of Fourth Avenue and
Twenty-Third Street, and the movement on the whole
was getting much publicity and proving very successful
in its work among young men. But it was an institution
for Christians, and it occurred to several of us&mdash;as I
remember it, there were two of my fellow members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bar, Meyer S. Isaacs and Isaac S. Isaacs; Dr. Simeon N.
Leo, Solomon B. Solomon, and myself&mdash;that it would
be a useful undertaking if we organized a Young Men's
Hebrew Association for the cultural and intellectual
advancement of Jewish young men. After a few preliminary
meetings we launched our project early in 1874.
We rented a house in the vicinity of Nineteenth or
Twentieth Street and began in a very modest way. Our
first entertainment was of a purely literary nature, and I
recollect on that occasion addressing the members of the
infant enterprise on the subject of literary clubs, ancient
and modern, from the time of Socrates and Plato to the
days of the coffee houses of Addison, Steele, and Goldsmith.
The Y.M.H.A. subsequently had its years of
struggle for existence, but to-day its place in our cities
as an influence for the development of culture and patriotism
is assured, as well as that of its sister organization
of later birth, the Young Women's Hebrew Association.</p>

<p>I had chosen the law as my profession, but I still
wrote verse, and in the decade following my graduation
published several pieces. At one memorable event I was
invited to deliver an original poem. It was in 1875, at a
large fair in Gilmore's Garden, the predecessor of the
present Madison Square Garden. The fair was held to
raise funds toward the erection of a new building for the
Mount Sinai Hospital, and the immense auditorium was
crowded. Samuel J. Tilden, then Governor of New York
and also prospective Democratic nominee for President,
made the opening address. My poetic possibilities,
however, rested more upon aspiration than inspiration,
and my craving for versification was but a passing
phase of my literary activities.</p>

<p>About 1876 we removed our office to the New York
Life Building, then, as now, at 346 Broadway, corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Leonard Street. Our clientèle was mostly commercial
and this neighborhood seemed more convenient. Our
neighbors at the new location were Chamberlain, Carter
&amp; Eaton, a prominent commercial law firm of which
Charles E. Hughes subsequently became a member.</p>

<p>A few years later we took into our firm Simon Sterne,
then one of the brilliant younger members of the bar, and
our firm became Sterne, Hudson &amp; Straus. But Hudson
wanted to devote himself to patent law, in which he had
specialized somewhat, so the firm soon changed again to
Sterne, Straus &amp; Thompson. Daniel G. Thompson had
been our managing clerk. He had an attractive personality
and a philosophical temperament, but was more a
psychologist than a lawyer. He was author of several
works on the science and history of psychology which
were favorably received and commended by such men as
Herbert Spencer and other high authorities in both
Europe and America. These qualities made him a target
for the sarcasm of Sterne, who, on the other hand, was
thoroughly the lawyer. On one occasion I remember
Sterne asking me whether I knew Thompson was dissipating.
I expressed surprise, and Sterne went on:
"Certainly he is, for when he goes home he works till all
hours of the night writing psychology, and naturally
next day he comes with an exhausted brain to his legal
work. He might better go on a spree, for one gets over
that. But when one buries one's self in such an exacting
science he is lost for the law, which is a jealous mistress
and will not bear a rival."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Under the name of Sterne, Straus &amp; Thompson we had
a practice that ranged all the way from the collection of
debts to questions affecting street railways and public
utilities. Our old firm had a business like that of most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
young lawyers, but Sterne's practice was much more
important, his field being mainly banking and railroads.
Sterne, in fact, was rapidly achieving a reputation as an
authority in the State on railways and railway legislation.
At that time there was no Interstate Commerce Commission.
Many New York merchants were complaining,
through the New York Chamber of Commerce and the
New York Board of Trade and Transportation, that the
railroads were discriminating and giving to certain shippers
much lower rates than to others, also giving preference
to some in the moving of freight. In 1879 the
Legislature finally appointed a committee of eight men
to investigate these charges. A. Barton Hepburn, member
of the Assembly from St. Lawrence County, was
made chairman, causing the committee always thereafter
to be referred to as the Hepburn Committee. Sterne
represented the Chamber of Commerce and the Board
of Trade in this investigation.</p>

<p>The committee sat intermittently for about nine
months. The railroads had a brilliant array of legal
talent, but Sterne elicited testimony from them which
proved the charges of the merchants. Sterne then
drafted the report of the committee, which included
several recommendations for legislation. It was the first
impressive and well-directed attempt to deal with the
regulation of transportation companies, and resulted in
the passage, in 1880, of the bill creating the first Board
of Railroad Commissioners. Later, in 1887, the influence
of this work was still alive in connection with legislation
for the creation of the Federal Interstate Commerce
Commission. The business of our firm did not exactly
benefit by this public service of Sterne. As a result of his
public activities and settlement of litigation, such railway
clients as we had were lost to us at about this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>At this point in my career I have the fond recollection
of a dear and intimate friendship, which continued for
several years, with Joseph H. Choate, of the firm of
Evarts, Southmayd &amp; Choate. We used to ride horseback
together in the park before breakfast. This intimacy
naturally was very valuable to me. We discussed
all manner of topics, not only affecting our profession,
but touching many public matters and the philosophy of
life and living in general. In these morning hours, with
the exhilaration of our ride, Mr. Choate was always full
of fun and good humor. He was the most sought after
person for addressing all important public functions, and
frequently he would outline the substance of his addresses.
Speaking one day of the many demands upon
him as a speaker, he remarked that he appeared to be
in the fashion just then, but, like wall-paper, fashions
change, and it was not likely to last long. In his case,
however, the fashion lasted, even increased, until his
death in 1917.</p>

<p>My major law work was in the most exacting and
nerve-racking branch, the trying of cases. My general
physical condition, though never robust, was none the
less good, but I had not learned what one is more apt to
acquire later in life: to conserve my energies. The result
was that the wear and tear of court work reduced my
weight to one hundred and five pounds. My physician
strongly advised me to do less exacting work, and especially
to stop trying cases. As this branch of the law
appealed to me most, it was a grave disappointment to
have to abandon it. Rather than continue in the profession
with such an inhibition, therefore, I yielded to the
advice of my father and brother to join their firm.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I took a vacation of several months, and upon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
return early in 1881 I became a member of L. Straus &amp;
Sons, who had become large manufacturers and importers
of china and glassware. On account of the growing business
they really needed my services, and my transition
from professional to business man was made as acceptable
and agreeable as possible. As was to be expected, I continued
for some time to long for "the fleshpots of Egypt,"
for I was much attached to my profession. As a compensation,
and to satisfy my intellectual longings, I devoted
my evenings and spare time to historical reading and study.</p>

<p>Having embarked on a business career, I reversed a
decision that I made while practicing law. As a lawyer I
had taken very seriously and literally the saying that
"the law is a jealous mistress." I was her devoted slave,
quite willingly so, and I determined never to marry. I
was economically independent as a single man and could
devote my time to the law for its own sake. This I preferred
to do, as the idealist that I was, rather than pursue
the law for economic reasons first and for its own sake as
much as possible secondarily, which I felt would have to
be the case if I married. But as a business man things
were different, and I decided now to marry.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On January 22, 1882, I became engaged to Sarah, only
daughter of Louis and Hannah Seller Lavanburg, and
we were married on the 19th of April following, at the
home of her parents on West Forty-Sixth Street, near
Fifth Avenue. At the wedding dinner, to which had
come hosts of our friends and acquaintances, Joaquin
Miller, poet of the Sierras, as he was called, read a poem
which he composed for the event. The manuscript I
think is still in my possession.</p>

<p>In the year of my marriage I also made my début in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
politics. I was secretary of the Executive Committee of
an independent group organized for the reëlection of
William R. Grace as mayor of New York. The distinguished
lawyer, Frederick R. Coudert, was chairman of
that committee. Grace had been a Tammany mayor and
given the city a good business administration&mdash;so good
and so independent that Tammany refused to nominate
him for a second term. On the independent ticket Grace
had a large Republican as well as the independent Democratic
support, and was duly elected.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I next took part in the Cleveland-Blaine campaign.
In 1884 we formed in New York City the Cleveland and
Hendricks Merchants' and Business Men's Association,
of which I was secretary of the executive committee, and
we coöperated with the Democratic National Committee,
Senator Arthur P. Gorman, chairman, whose
headquarters were at the old Fifth Avenue Hotel, corner
of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-Third Street. We organized
a parade and marched forty thousand strong from lower
Broadway to Thirty-Fourth Street. It was the first time
business men had ever been organized along political
lines.</p>

<p>All who remember this campaign know what an exciting
and close battle it was. The dramatic event which
doubtless put the balance in Cleveland's favor was the
speech of the Rev. Dr. Samuel D. Burchard, a Presbyterian
minister of New York, at Republican headquarters.
A few days before the election the Republican managers
had called what they termed a ministers' meeting, to
which came some six hundred clergymen of all denominations
to meet Mr. Blaine. Dr. Burchard, noted as an
orator, was to speak, followed by Mr. Blaine. In concluding
his address, Dr. Burchard evidently lost control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of his dignity, for he stigmatized the Democratic Party
as the party of "rum, Romanism, and rebellion." In the
face of the great efforts the Republican Party had made,
with some measure of success, to secure the Roman
Catholic vote, this denunciation gave a big opportunity
to the Democrats. Furthermore, Blaine, keen a politician
as he was, failed immediately to repudiate the remark.</p>

<p>I was present at Democratic headquarters when the
reporter who had been sent to this meeting returned.
Senator Gorman asked him to read from his shorthand
notes, and when he came to the expression, "rum, Romanism,
and rebellion," Gorman at once said, "Write
that out." The Democratic managers saw their chance.
Quickly the whole country was placarded with posters
headed "R.R.R.," with all sorts of variations and additions
of the original phrase. In the end it was the New
York vote that determined the victory for the Democrats,
and doubtless because of the influence the words
of Dr. Burchard had had upon Roman Catholic voters.</p>

<p>When the election returns were in, Cleveland had won
by only 1047 votes. Because of the closeness of the vote
in New York the Republicans did not at first concede the
victory. Among the Democrats, on the other hand, there
was a great feeling of bitterness and nervous apprehension
lest an effort be made to make it a Republican
victory, as was the case in 1876 when the uncertain
returns were decided by an electoral commission, which,
to the disappointment of many, made its decision on
party lines. Jay Gould, who controlled the telegraph
lines, was accused by the Democrats of holding back
returns.</p>

<p>The Merchants' and Business Men's Association
promptly organized a large meeting in the Academy of
Music, to proclaim and celebrate Cleveland's election.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
August Belmont, Sr., as chairman, presided, and I, as
secretary, presented the resolutions. We had invited the
most prominent speakers we could get, and there were
Henry Ward Beecher, Daniel Dougherty of Philadelphia,
Algernon S. Sullivan, among others. I distinctly recall
a humorous and cryptic remark of Beecher's address
that day: "If the chair is too small, make it larger"&mdash;referring
to Cleveland's avoirdupois and the claim that he
did not fit in the presidential chair. The note of victory,
and the determination to stand by that victory at all
costs, had a reassuring effect throughout the country.</p>

<p>When the campaign was over I was told by a member
of the National Committee that if there was any
political office to which I aspired, the Committee would
be glad to further any ambition I might have; but I
replied my only wish was that Cleveland live up to the
political principles which had brought him the support
of so many independent or "mugwump" voters and so
made possible his election.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the winter of 1883-84 the Young Men's Hebrew
Association invited me to speak in their course of
lectures. I was to choose my own subject. They had
hired Chickering Hall, at Fifth Avenue and Fifteenth
Street, a large lecture hall in those days, and as great
importance was being attached to the occasion I naturally
put my best foot forward in the preparation of my
material. I chose as my theme "The Origin of the Republican
Form of Government." In it I traced the rise
of democracy, in contradistinction to monarchy, from
the Hebrew Commonwealth as expounded in the Old
Testament and interpreted by the early Puritans of New
England, especially in their "election sermons," which
were of a politico-religious character and were delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
annually before the legislatures of the various New England
colonies.</p>

<p>There was a huge audience, and the next morning the
press gave very generous reports of the address. It attracted
the attention of various ministers in Brooklyn,
and subsequently I was asked to repeat it before the
Long Island Historical Society, in that city. There I had
an amusing experience. In the course of the talk I quoted
ideas similar to mine that had been advanced over a
hundred years before by Thomas Paine in his "Common
Sense," and I referred to the high estimates of Paine held
by Washington, Monroe, Dr. Rush, and others of the
time. I refrained from expressing opinions of my own,
contenting myself with a reference to those of the fathers
of the Republic. Suddenly, however, several ministers
left the hall, protesting that they had not come to hear
a eulogy on Paine.</p>

<p>Later I developed this address, under its original title,
and published it in book form. The first edition came
out in 1885. The appearance of a first book is quite an
event in one's life, especially when it is well received
among critics and by the press. At any rate, it seemed
like a landmark in my own life. Historical writers referred
to it as a distinct contribution to our historical
literature, and I felt that so far as the pen was concerned
I had discovered this branch of writing to be my forte
rather than poetry. After all, historical writing is no
less imaginative than poetry. Without the use of imagination
history is lifeless and a dry record of facts
instead of literature.</p>

<p>A second impression of the book was issued in 1887,
and in 1901 a second and revised edition was published.
A French edition had appeared simultaneously in Paris
and Brussels, 1890, translated by M. Emile de Laveleye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
eminent Belgian publicist and professor at the University
of Liége, and containing an introductory essay by him.
This essay was translated into English and embodied in
the 1901 American edition. Since then additional impressions
of this revised edition have appeared. I might
mention that on the strength of this book I was admitted
to membership in the Authors' Club, in 1888.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the fall of the year following the original publication
of my first book I chanced to meet Senator Gorman
of Maryland in the Palmer House, Chicago, where we
both happened to be stopping&mdash;he on his return from
a trip to the Far West, and I on an important business
errand. He told me he and his son had read my book on
their trip, and that he had not in a long time read a book
with so much valuable information in it and giving such
a clear view of the sources and early growth of our form
of government. We naturally talked of matters political,
and he reminded me of an earlier conversation he had had
with me since Cleveland's election, stating that Mr. Cox&mdash;S.S.
Cox&mdash;our minister to Turkey, had or was about
to resign, and that he would like to recommend me to
President Cleveland for appointment in Cox's place. He
thought at the same time it might enable me to make
further studies along the lines of my book.</p>

<p>The idea was a complete surprise to me. As I have
mentioned, I had no thought of entering public life. My
political activities had been limited to the part I took in
the re-election of Mayor Grace and the Cleveland-Blaine,
campaign. Even had I been ambitious for a political
position I should never have ventured application for a
diplomatic post, for I had never given much attention to
our foreign relations. Besides, I had been in business only
a few years, I was married and had two small daughters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
everything considered, I felt I could not afford to leave
my affairs to go abroad.</p>

<p>Upon returning to New York I conferred with my
father and brothers, and their attitude changed my views
somewhat. They generously offered to see that my interests
should not suffer, and gave me every encouragement
to entertain Senator Gorman's suggestion. I could not
possibly have further considered the subject without this
generosity on their part. My obligations to my family
did not permit the expenditure of several times my salary,
required in a position of this kind. The salary of minister
to Turkey had been reduced to seven thousand five hundred
dollars, though it was subsequently restored to ten
thousand; and in order to live properly he had to rent a
winter house in the capital and a summer house outside,
or live in hotels as Mr. Cox, and his predecessor, General
Lew Wallace, did. General Wallace was restricted to his
salary and felt compelled to decline the invitations of his
colleagues because he was not in position to reciprocate.
(His "Ben Hur," by the way, he had written before his
sojourn in the East, and not afterward as is often supposed.)</p>

<p>Senator Gorman was not finally able to make the
recommendation he had proposed. His relations with
the President became strained, so that recommendations
for appointments coming from him were not regarded
with favor by Cleveland. Gorman told me as much when
we met subsequently, but advised me to use such influence
as I might command in other directions.</p>

<p>I presently spoke of it to an old friend of my days in
the law, B. Franklin Einstein, who was counsel for the
"New York Times" and the personal adviser of George
Jones, its proprietor. Einstein suggested that I speak
with Jones about it, and this I did. Jones encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
me and said he would be glad to help. He said he had
read my book and felt sure I would give a good account
of myself and be a credit to the administration; that he
had never asked any favor of the administration and felt
justified in asking Cleveland to make the appointment.
The "Times" had been an independent Republican
paper, but in the campaign of 1884 it came out for Cleveland.</p>

<p>I also conferred with Carl Schurz, with whom I stood
on intimate terms, and with John Foord, another friend.
In the early eighties we used to have a lunch club that
met about once in two weeks at a little French restaurant,
August Sieghortner's, at 32 Lafayette Place, now Lafayette
Street, in a house that had been a former residence
of one of the Astors. We used to discuss various political
and reform matters&mdash;the "mugwump" movement, the
Cleveland campaigns, or what not. There were ten or
twelve of us, and Carl Schurz was one; the late Charles R.
Miller, who was for many years the leading editorial
writer of the "Times," was another; and John Foord,
whose death by accident occurred in Washington only
a few days ago as I write, was another. Foord was then
editor-in-chief of the "Times." He took up my appointment
with both President Cleveland and Secretary of
State Bayard. Schurz encouraged me and said he would
speak to Oswald Ottendorfer about having me appointed.
Ottendorfer, proprietor of the "New Yorker Staatszeitung,"
was a client of our law firm and knew me
well. Subsequently I saw him and he wrote to Cleveland
strongly recommending the appointment.</p>

<p>Cleveland was favorably enough impressed, but he
hesitated. He said our chief concern in Turkey was the
protection of American missionary interests, and he
would not like to appoint any one to this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
mission who might be objected to by the two principal
missionary bodies&mdash;the American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions and the Presbyterian Board of Missions.</p>

<p>It happened that on a return trip from Washington
about this time my brother Isidor met A. S. Barnes,
prominent textbook publisher and a member of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
to whom also I was quite well known. He had been in
frequent consultation with our law firm when we represented
the City of Brooklyn in its suit against the
Atlantic Avenue Railroad to compel the road to sink
its tracks, in which suit, as one of Brooklyn's public-spirited
citizens, he was much interested. He was sympathetic
toward me and brought the subject of my appointment
before his missionary board, with the result
that its Prudential Committee wrote a letter to the
President expressing fullest approval of my appointment,
suggesting only that I be asked not to hold receptions
on the Sabbath, as one of my predecessors had done
to the great disapproval of the missionaries and all
Protestant Christians in Constantinople. Even without
this intimation I would quite naturally have refrained
from offending the religious sensibilities of my
nationals at that post.</p>

<p>The representatives of all the Protestant churches
who had interests in Turkey were most generous in
favoring the appointment when they learned that I was
being considered for that mission. The most admired
and best beloved American preacher of his time, Henry
Ward Beecher, of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, heard of
it through Mr. O. A. Gager, one of the trustees of his
church; also that there was some diffidence about my
actual selection because of my religion. He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wrote the President a beautiful and characteristic letter,
urging my appointment. The original of this letter, now
in my possession, was given to me by Governor Porter,
first assistant Secretary of State.</p>

<p>With my wife I had gone to Atlantic City for a few
days, to recuperate from a cold, when on March 24, 1887,
I received telegrams from friends all over the country
congratulating me on my appointment as minister to
Turkey. The papers of the day announced it, and the
"New York Times" published the Beecher letter just
referred to.</p>

<p>To the press of the country my appointment was of
added interest because of the Keiley incident of two years
before. A. M. Keiley, of Virginia, was nominated by Cleveland
as minister to Austria-Hungary, but objected to by
that country because Mrs. Keiley, being of Jewish parentage,
was <i>persona non grata</i>. As a matter of fact this
excuse for the rejection of Keiley was supposedly made
because the Austro-Hungarian Government thought it
might be acceptable to us in lieu of the truth.</p>

<p>The real reason lay much deeper. Keiley had earlier
been nominated as minister to Italy. The Italian Government,
through its representative at Washington, made
known to our Department of State that Keiley would be
<i>persona non grata</i> because it was remembered that in
1870 he had made a public speech in Richmond violently
denouncing King Victor Emmanuel for his treatment of
the Pope. The nomination was therefore withdrawn. And
when a few months later Keiley was appointed minister
to Austria-Hungary, that country, being a member with
Italy in the Triple Alliance, did not want to run the risk
of displeasing Italy by accepting a representative not
satisfactory to her; but not wishing to admit this, based
its excuse on religious grounds.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>This so incensed our Administration that Secretary
Bayard rebuked the Austro-Hungarian Government with
the statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is not within the power of the President nor of the Congress,
nor of any judicial tribunal in the United States, to take
or even hear testimony, or in any mode to inquire into or
decide upon the religious belief of any official, and the proposition
to allow this to be done by any foreign Government is
necessarily and <i>a fortiori</i> inadmissible.</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mr. Cleveland made reference to the episode in his
First Annual Message to Congress:</p>

<blockquote><p>The reasons advanced were such as could not be acquiesced
in, without violation of my oath of office and the precepts of
the Constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation
in favor of a foreign government upon the right of selection
by the Executive, and required such an application of a religious
test as a qualification for office under the United States
as would have resulted in the practical disfranchisement of a
large class of our citizens and the abandonment of a vital principle
of our Government.</p></blockquote>

<p>These statements contain a clear exposition of one of
the fundamental principles of our laws and system of
government; they form one of the most illuminating and
inspiring chapters of our diplomatic literature. Following
the Keiley incident, my appointment was a silent but
effective protest against such illiberal views as those
expressed by Austria-Hungary; and to me personally it
meant something to be sent as the representative of my
country to the power whose dominion extended over the
land that cradled my race, Palestine.</p>

<p>Leaving Atlantic City, we soon proceeded to Washington,
where I called on Secretary Bayard, who received
me with characteristic cordiality and referred me to
John Bassett Moore, now our famous authority on international
law, compiler of the International Law Digest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
American judge of the Court of International Justice
by vote of the Council and Assembly of the League of
Nations. At the time I met him, thirty-five years ago,
he was third assistant Secretary of State, and I could not
have wished for a better instructor in the intricate matters
that involved our relations with the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Alvey A. Adee, veteran of our Foreign Office, then as
now the second assistant Secretary of State, was another
man who gave me most helpful advice. His encyclopædic
knowledge of our foreign relations for more than forty
years is remarkable, and our diplomatic appointees for
years have been indebted to him for much helpful guidance.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Later in the day we called on the President. Our conversation
during this call was purely of a general nature,
and as I was leaving Mr. Cleveland expressed pleasure at
my promptness in calling and hoped that I would start
for Turkey as soon as personal convenience permitted.
When I told him I hoped to sail at the end of a week,
he answered, "That is businesslike; I like that," and he
asked me to call again before leaving Washington.</p>

<p>Two days later, by appointment of Colonel Lamont,
the President's secretary, Mrs. Straus and I, accompanied
by brother Isidor and E. G. Dunnell, "New York Times"
correspondent, called on Mrs. Cleveland in the Green
Room of the White House. I vividly recall this visit.
Mrs. Cleveland came into the room with a sprightly and
unceremonious walk, very friendly, with charm of manner
and a sufficient familiarity to put us entirely at our
ease. She was a very handsome woman, with remarkable
sweetness of expression, and her appearance symbolized
beauty and simplicity.</p>

<p>What most impressed me about the Clevelands, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
these two visits, was the simple, unassuming manner
that was so in keeping with the spirit of our laws and the
democracy of our institutions. Verily, I thought in the
words of Cleveland himself, "a public office is a public
trust," and while administering office we are indeed
servants of the people.</p>

<p>Before leaving Washington we again called on the
President as agreed. His entire conversation and attitude
showed satisfaction with my appointment. He
said he understood the missionaries were doing good
work, and he felt sure from what he had learned of me
that they would receive impartial and just treatment at
my hands. He commented on the fact that the press of
the country had been so unanimously in favor of my
appointment. "I wished they would go for you a little;
I have something to give them," he said. From Mr.
Dunnell later I learned the meaning of this remark. He
had received a letter from the Prudential Committee of
the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
highly approving of his appointing me as minister
to Turkey and endorsing me of their own accord in unqualified
terms. This letter he was holding to give to the
press should any unfavorable comment be made because
a member of the Hebrew race was being sent to a post
where the Christian mission interests were so large. Mr.
Cleveland's parting remark to me was: "I know you will
do well; I have no trepidation&mdash;none at all."</p>

<p>On Saturday, April 9th, at 6 <span class="smcap"><small>A.M.</small></span>, we&mdash;my wife,
Aline, the younger of our little daughters, and myself&mdash;sailed
out of the harbor on the S.S. Aurania. My one
prayer in bidding farewell to my home was that I might
find no vacant seat at my table upon my return, and that
I might discharge my high trust with credit and honor.
For this no sacrifice would be too great.</p>

<p>Our voyage was not altogether a light one. We had
found it expedient to leave Mildred, our elder daughter,
then four years old, with her Grandma Lavanburg; and
while she was in excellent hands my wife was naturally
heavy-hearted at the thought of traveling so far and for
so long without her. The weather on board ship was for
the most part stormy. Our little Aline and her nurse
were so seasick that the child resented being on board
with all the force of age three. "Mama, this ship is nobody's
home; why did you bring me here? I shall write
sister Milly never to go on the ocean," she declared rebelliously.</p>

<p>Having reached London, however, things went more
pleasantly. Our minister there at the time&mdash;we did not
yet appoint ambassadors&mdash;was Edward J. Phelps, for
many years Professor of International Law at Yale, a
scholarly gentleman. I called on him almost immediately
on my arrival, and subsequently Mrs. Straus and I dined
at the legation to meet Rustem Pasha, Turkish ambassador,
veteran diplomat who had been in the service for
thirty-three years and was about twice as old. He was
leading Turkish representative at the Congress of Berlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in 1878, following the Russo-Turkish War. He referred
to the various questions pending between his Government
and mine&mdash;the interpretation of Article 4 of the Treaty
of 1830, signed only in Turkish; the proposed treaty of
1874, negotiated by Minister Boker and not confirmed
by the Senate, concerning naturalized citizens of the
United States returning to Turkey; missionary matters;
our refusal to negotiate a treaty for the extradition of
criminals. I had informed myself regarding all of these,
but I deemed it wise not to discuss them in detail; rather
I chose to be the listener and draw him out, assuring him
that when I arrived at my post all these subjects would
have my very best attention. He was particularly concerned
with the treaty for the extradition of criminals,
but the so-called criminals that came to the United States
at that period, especially from Russia and Turkey, were
with rare exception political refugees, and it is provided
in most of our extradition treaties that political offenders
are not to be delivered up.</p>

<p>We remained in London about ten days, calling on a
number of interesting people. We spent one pleasant
evening with Dr. and Mrs. John Chapman, of the "Westminster
Review." My article on "The Development of
Religious Liberty in America" was appearing in a current
number of the "Review." The Chapmans were good
friends of George Eliot and Professor Lewes. In fact, the
novelist and the professor first met at the Chapman
home. Dr. Chapman also told me he was the one who
first employed George Eliot in literary work. He became
editor of the "Review" in 1851 and engaged her as associate
editor. When George Eliot resigned, Mrs. Chapman
became the associate editor. With us that evening,
too, was Harold Frederic, London correspondent of the
"New York Times" and a novelist of some promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>From Messrs. J. &amp; W. Seligman of New York I had
received a letter to the Seligman banking house in London,
at 3 Angel Court. Mr. Isaac Seligman invited us to
dine <i>en famille</i>, and arranged for me to call at Messrs.
N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons', where I was very pleasantly
received by Baron Alfred Charles de Rothschild, who
showed me through his magnificent banking establishment
and offered to send me a letter to the Paris Rothschild
firm. The Baron was then about forty-four years
old, very agreeable, a polished gentleman of the best
Jewish type.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In Paris, our next stopping-place, we also had a very
interesting time. Of course we called on our minister,
Robert M. McLane, then seventy-four years old, but
looking sixty. He was distinctly of the old school, with
all the grace of manner, combined with ability and wide
experience in public service&mdash;an excellent representative
who was esteemed by the French people quite as highly as
by our own citizens in France. I speak of this especially
because in capitals like Paris it is not an easy task to
please both elements.</p>

<p>At dinner one evening in the home of my friend
Adolphe Salmon, an American merchant residing in
Paris, we met Count Dillon and his wife, most affable
people to whom we felt ourselves immediately attracted.
The Count was a thorough Royalist, had been for many
years in the army. At this time he was managing director
of the Mackay-Bennett Cable Company and the leader
of a movement, really anti-Republican intrigue, designed
to put General Boulanger, Minister of War, at the head
of the State. The Count was a close personal friend and
schoolmate of Boulanger, then the most extolled man in
all France. The Count suggested that he arrange a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
luncheon or dinner to have us meet the General, if that
was agreeable to us, for he felt sure the General would
be pleased.</p>

<p>Consequently a few days later we lunched at Count
Dillon's beautiful villa some thirty minutes outside of
Paris. It was an intimate two-hour luncheon party, just
Mr. and Mrs. Adolphe Salmon, the Count and Countess
Dillon, General Boulanger, Mrs. Straus, and myself.
Boulanger was a young-looking man for his fifty years, of
medium height and weight, wearing a closely trimmed
beard; rather Anglo-American than French in appearance,
unassuming, of pleasant expression, and probably at the
height of his power. Five years before he had been Director
of Infantry in the War Office and made himself
very popular as a military reformer. In 1886, under the
ægis of Clemenceau and the Radical Party which brought
Freycinet into power, Boulanger was made Minister of
War. He was noted for his fire-eating attitude toward
Germany in connection with the Schnaebele frontier incident,
and because of this was hailed as the man destined
to give France her revenge for the disasters of 1870. In
fact, the masses looked upon him as a second Napoleon,
"the man on horseback," and his picture on horseback
was displayed in countless shop windows.</p>

<p>At our luncheon party he entertained us with many an
interesting anecdote, and I particularly recall his telling
of coming to the Yorktown Centennial Celebration and
traveling as far as the Pacific Coast in company with
General Sherman to see our fortifications. "I was asked
what I thought of your American fortifications ["You
know what antiquated and insignificant things they are,"
in an aside to Mrs. Straus], and I praised them and said
I thought they were splendid, that I had never seen any
better ones because"&mdash;and here his eyes twinkled&mdash;"no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
country has such nice ditches in front of its fortifications,"
He meant, of course, the Atlantic and the Pacific.</p>

<p>When the champagne was being drunk and toasts were
in order I turned to the General, after drinking to the
health of the company, and said: "May you administer
the War Department so successfully that posterity will
know you as the great preserver of peace." To this he
responded that for fifteen years France had always been
on the defensive and permitted insults rather than take
offense, but that the time had come when she could no
longer do so and must be ready for the offensive. He
evidently had in mind that war was imminent. At a later
meeting he asked me whether, in case of war, I would be
willing to take charge of French interests in Turkey. I
told him that while of course it would be agreeable to
me personally, such action could be taken only under the
authority of my government, which authority I would
have to obtain before giving an official answer.</p>

<p>The subsequent meteoric career of Boulanger is a
matter of history. For two years more his personality
was one of the dominating factors of French politics. I
remember writing from Constantinople early in 1889:
"The most menacing condition exists in France, where, I
am of opinion, Boulanger will gain the presidency before
many months and from that time perhaps try to tread
in the footprints of his Napoleonic ideal. If so&mdash;alas,
poor France, and alas the peace of Europe!" He had
become an open menace to the republic; and when Constans
was Minister of the Interior a prosecution was
instituted against Boulanger and a warrant signed for his
arrest. He fled from Paris and was afterward tried and
condemned <i>in absentia</i> for treason. In 1891 he committed
suicide on the grave of his mistress in a cemetery at Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>We dined, on another evening in Paris, with Mr. and
Mrs. William Seligman, of the banking firm of Seligman
Frères, the Paris branch of J. &amp; W. Seligman of New
York and of the London Seligman establishment. This
dinner was a very large and elaborate affair, with many
distinguished guests present. After dinner we were entertained
by the budding genius of Josef Hofmann, then
ten or eleven years old.</p>

<p>The noted Hungarian, Munkacsy, painter of "Last
Day of a Condemned Man," "Christ before Pilate,"
"Christ on Calvary," and other celebrated works, was
also there with his wife. As a couple they presented a
striking contrast indeed. He was a silent man, talking
very little and haltingly; he impressed one as a refined
artisan of some sort, perhaps a carpenter. He was a large
man of about five feet ten in height, with bushy hair
combed up, bushy beard and mustache, and small eyes
which he screwed up to almost nothing when observing
something. His wife, on the other hand, was as coarse-looking
a woman as one might discover, with a loud,
raucous, almost masculine voice which, like a saw in
action, rose above every other sound. However, I have
observed that these contraries in personality in couples
often make for happiness.</p>

<p>The artist seemed to take a keen interest in Mrs.
Straus. He quite embarrassed her by his constant staring,
and after dinner sought an introduction and sat next
to her. Her plain hair-dress, smoothly brushed back and
rolled in a coil behind, fascinated him. He remarked how
natural and becoming it was and wanted to know whether
she always wore it that way; he wondered whether it
would be as becoming any other way. He wanted to
know how long we should remain in Paris and expressed
regret when told we were leaving in three or four days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Mrs. Straus felt he had studied her head long enough
to paint it from memory. And who knows, perhaps
he has used it in some painting that we have not yet discovered!</p>

<p>Another memorable dinner was at the home of Eli
Lazard, of Lazard Frères, bankers, where we met Judge
Wilson and daughters, of Cincinnati. All of these hospitalities
were very pleasant, but personally I should have
been glad to escape them, for the late hours, together
with the rich cooking of Paris, were not in accord with
my quiet habits and simple tastes in food and drink.</p>

<p>In Vienna I called on our consul-general, Edmund
Jussen, whose wife was the sister of my esteemed friend
Carl Schurz, which fact really prompted me to make the
call. Jussen himself was not very admirable. He had
much of the arrogance of a German official, so out of
place in an American representative. However, during
our sojourn in the city he and his wife exchanged several
visits with us. Mrs. Jussen did not much resemble her
distinguished brother, except for an expression about the
eyes. She was a very amiable woman with a good face.
She told me much of her brother's childhood and school
years&mdash;how he had to struggle hard for his education.
Their father was a small shopkeeper, but no business man,
and was never able to make money. Carl did not earn
money, but always applied himself diligently. This and
much more that has since been published about Schurz
interested me greatly, of course.</p>

<p>We continued our journey to Varna on the Black Sea,
there to take the steamer for Constantinople. In those
days there was no railway connection with Constantinople.
The Oriental Express went only to Varna, by way
of Bucharest. On that particular part of our journey we
got our first glimpses of the picturesque costumes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Balkan district, especially those of the men with their
bare legs and flying shirts.</p>

<p>The trip from Varna to Constantinople was beautiful
and inspiring. We boarded the boat at about four in the
afternoon and retired early so as to be up by five or six
next morning, when we passed through the Bosphorus,
round which clusters so much of classical memory. I
suddenly realized how much of my Homer I had forgotten&mdash;the
Homer on whom I had spent years of hard
study. However, most of us meet so many new subjects
that have a more direct relation to our surroundings that
it is next to impossible to get that "elegant leisure"
necessary for a continued interest in the classics.</p>

<p>The effect of the trip through the Bosphorus is quite
like a dream. The high coast on both sides is covered
with green, with here and there a house or some large
huts; on one side is Europe and on the other side Asia,
looking very much alike, bathed by the same sunshine,
peaceful.</p>

<p>We sailed past Buyukdereh, Therapia, the summer
residence of most of the diplomats, about twelve miles
from Constantinople, where the English, French, Austrian,
and Russian embassies had magnificent palaces and
the Germans were engaged in building; on past the lovely
old towers of Roumeli-Hissar, built eight hundred years
before, when first the Turks set foot in Europe, and back
of this the tower of Robert College.</p>

<p>Suddenly my ever-smiling and happy wife spied a
launch flying a large United States flag at the stern. "It's
our launch!" And sure enough, when we waved our
handkerchiefs we discovered the members of my official
family, who had come in the legation launch to meet us.
There were Pendleton King, acting chargé d'affaires;
Mr. Gargiulo, dragoman; J. Lynch Pringle, consul-general;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Mehmet, the <i>cavass</i>; and several clerks of the
consulate and legation.</p>

<p>The <i>cavass</i>, by the way, is a sort of bodyguard. He
walks before the minister, or rides on the box beside the
driver, and serves the purpose of designating that the
minister or ambassador follows. He carries two huge
pistols and a sword suspended from a gold belt, and his
coat, sometimes red and sometimes blue, is much bebraided
and embroidered. The natives know each minister
or ambassador by his <i>cavass</i>.</p>

<p>Our first impression from the windows of the Royal
Hotel in Constantinople was of picturesque dirt. As
Mrs. Straus said at the time, dirt not only on the hard
earth roads and the people, but even on the dogs. In
time, however, one is less impressed by the dirt than by
the picturesqueness&mdash;the venders calling out their
wares of fish, fruit, meat, vegetables, all carried on the
edges of baskets covered with leaves; the water-carriers
with their urns carried on yokes; and the veiled women.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Immediately upon my arrival, of course, I communicated
with His Excellency, Saïd Pasha, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, to present my credentials and arrange
for an audience with His Majesty the Sultan, Abdul
Hamid. The Pasha replied at once, appointing a time
two days later, and accordingly I went to the Sublime
Porte, as the Turkish Government seat is called, in company
with the chargé and the dragoman or interpreter.
That was about May 26th. Not until June 6th, however,
did I receive a communication from Munir Pasha, Grand
Master of Ceremonies, that His Majesty had named June
8th for my audience. The next evening I received a
telegram postponing the audience to the 10th. On the
9th I received another communication, postponing it <i>sine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
die</i>. On the 15th a new appointment was made for the
17th; then, between midnight and one o'clock on the
night of June 16th-17th, the personal secretary of the
Sultan came knocking at the door of my apartment, and,
after apologizing for his arrival at that untimely hour,
informed me that he had come at the Sultan's special
request to say that word had come from the Porte that
June 17th was a most sacred day, a fact just determined
by the phases of the moon, and the Sultan therefore was
constrained to postpone the audience again. The date
was later set for July 1st, when I finally had my audience.</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of Abdul Hamid to delay audiences
to new representatives for weeks and sometimes months
by these successive appointments and postponements, to
no other purpose than to impress the agents of foreign
governments with the importance of His Majesty. In
my case there was some added cause: it was the month of
Ramazan, during which only the most pressing official
functions take place.</p>

<p>Ramazan, ninth month of the Turkish calendar, is a
period of fasting. For twenty-nine days every Mussulman
abstains from food and water, and even smoking,
from sunrise to sunset; which the rich arrange conveniently
by sleeping all day and eating all night, while the
poor who have to work all day eat at sundown, at midnight,
and very early in the morning. The first meal
after the fasting, at sunset, is called <i>iltar</i>. The fast is
broken with Ramazan bread, a cakelike bread, circular
in shape, which we saw much in evidence at a bazaar in
the courtyard of a mosque at Stamboul, the more Oriental
part of Constantinople, where the costumes of
Greeks, Armenians, Turks, and Arabs form a strange
mixture indeed.</p>

<p>During Beiram, a three days' feasting following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Ramazan, the mosques are all illuminated at night, and
the view over the water, with the moving lights of boats
in the foreground and the dimly lighted houses beyond,
interspersed with brightly illumined mosques, is quite
like a picture of some enchanted land.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Because of the Sultan's peculiarities in receiving foreign
representatives, the custom in regard to official calls
at Constantinople is different from that at most capitals.
Elsewhere calls on colleagues are not made until after a
minister or ambassador has had his audience; but here
usage dictated calling on one's colleagues as soon as possible.
Therefore I called first on Baron de Calice, ambassador
from Austria-Hungary and <i>doyen</i> of the diplomatic
corps. He received me with great cordiality and kindness,
and advised me fully regarding diplomatic practices
at Constantinople. And we were welcomed by each and
all of my colleagues in turn, so that I found these calls
very much less disagreeable than I had anticipated; I
even enjoyed many of them. At each visit coffee or tea
was served, and generally cigarettes too, as is customary
with the Turks, which is wonderfully effective in taking
off the chill of diplomatic formalities. One soon gets to
expect these refreshments; it is a delightful custom that
might be adopted in other places to advantage.</p>

<p>Another reason why these formal calls were less formidable
than they might have been was that three days
after our arrival at the capital we were invited to a garden
party given by Lady White, wife of the British ambassador,
Sir William A. White. This served to give us
a prompt introduction to all my colleagues. In fact, in
the five weeks intervening between our arrival and my
audience, we had attended so many garden parties and
dinners given to us, that I found myself heartily longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for respite. My natural inclination was to regard
these social gatherings in the light of idle frivolities,
especially in the summer, when one is supposed to be
relatively free from functions of this kind; and I was not
alone among my colleagues in preferring more evenings
at home to the occasional headaches that it cost to continue
the very late hours these many engagements forced
us to keep. Yet I could not consistently decline invitations;
such a course might have been interpreted as a
desire on my part to withdraw from the diplomatic circle
and would have interfered with the pleasant social relations
it was incumbent on me to cultivate. Attendance
was really part of my duty, and in time I found these
functions distinctly advantageous.</p>

<p>We looked forward with more than usual interest to the
evening of our dinner at the Persian embassy. The Persian
ambassador's wife had been a Circassian slave, whom
he was said to have bought for £300 with a horse thrown
into the bargain. The ambassador's wife was, of course,
typically Circassian; chalky white skin, soft black eyes,
small features, an unattractive figure unattractively
dressed, with whom conversation was almost nil because
she knew only Persian.</p>

<p>The streets of Pera, the European part of Constantinople,
are exceedingly narrow and very hilly, for the
city is built on several hills, like ancient Rome; in addition
they are poorly paved and dirty. This makes driving
dangerous and, as in mediæval times, sedan chairs were
quite generally in use as a means of conveyance for the
ladies of the diplomatic corps and the wives of the higher
Turkish officials, especially at night to dinners and other
official functions. Two sinewy porters carry these chairs,
one in front and the other behind, and they shuffle along
with considerable rapidity. Usually the lady is carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
while the gentleman, preceded by his <i>cavass</i> in the case
of a diplomat, walks alongside, except in inclement
weather when he follows also in a chair. I am reminded of
the wife of the German ambassador at the time, a large,
heavy woman, whom the porters quite justly charged
double. She, however, was entirely oblivious of her extra
avoirdupois and always complained of the injustice of
these porters! The Austrian and Russian embassies
were particularly difficult of approach by conveyance
other than the sedan.</p>

<p>We certainly were living in a new sphere of life, in a
strange land among strange people, with customs and
habits that brought to mind the age of the patriarchs.
There was much to see where some thirty nationalities
lived and did business as if in their own homes&mdash;much to
wonder at, much to deplore, much to praise and admire.
The natives are a peculiar people, with many admirable
characteristics; they are kind and hospitable, comparatively
honest and reliable, especially the lower classes,
and they manifest a most sincere devotion to their
religion. The lower classes are poor, very poor; yet they
are content and reasonably happy because their wants
are few. Their poverty is not a suffering condition and
they seemed to be better off than the poor elsewhere.
Their religion strictly interdicts the use of alcoholic
drinks, and as they are true to it and live faithfully up to
its principles, they are spared all the evils that fall in the
train of drunkenness.</p>

<p>During the weeks that I waited for my audience with
the Sultan I devoted my time to studying in detail the
various questions in regard to our diplomatic relations, so
that I might be better informed when they came up. This
study was very interesting from an historical point of
view, for some of the questions were related to capitulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that dated as far back as the fall of Constantinople
in 1453. My legal training also proved valuable in enabling
me to understand and handle matters.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On our first Friday in Constantinople we witnessed
Selamlik, the picturesque ceremony held with great
pomp every Friday, attending the Sultan's going to the
mosque. The Sultan's mosque is on the top of a hill commanding
the most beautiful view of the city, from which
can be seen the Bosphorus and, farther on, the Sea of
Marmora. On the roads surrounding the mosque as far
as the eye could see were ranged ten or more regiments of
infantry and cavalry, each dressed in glittering uniforms
according to the section of the empire from which they
came, the most resplendent being the Nubian and the
Arabian. The Sultan arrived in an open landau, and
opposite him Osman Pasha, distinguished soldier, hero
of the Battle of Plevna in the Russo-Turkish War, and
Grand Marshal of the Palace. The coachman was magnificently
dressed in scarlet and gold, and following were
the aides-de-camp, also beautifully dressed, one, an
Armenian, all in white and gold. As the Sultan entered
the mosque a priest chanted a call to prayer which
sounded not unlike the old Hebrew chants in some of our
synagogues. The mosque was so crowded that we could
see many Moslems kneeling and salaaming on the streets
outside the doors. The service lasted about twenty
minutes, whereupon the bands played and the Sultan reviewed
his troops from one of the windows of the mosque.
He then returned to the Palace in a beautiful top phaëton
drawn by two horses, which he drove himself, again with
Osman Pasha opposite, followed by his aides and the
carriage that had brought him. Usually several carriages,
open and closed, also several saddle horses, are brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
from the royal stables to the mosque, that the Sultan
may take his choice for his return to the Palace.</p>

<p>It is expected as a display of good will that the ministers
and ambassadors occasionally attend this ceremony. It
was practically the only occasion on which Abdul Hamid
appeared in public, for he constantly feared assassination,
and his expression showed his timidity. Following
Selamlik he quite frequently arranged to receive in
audience. In the kiosque or small house beside the
mosque, there is a special suite of rooms reserved for
the diplomatic corps. An aide informs the Sultan what
diplomatic representatives or other persons of distinction
are at the kiosque, to each of whom His Majesty then
sends some gracious message. While prayers are being
said in the mosque, the guests at the kiosque are served
coffee and cigarettes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One of the persons whom I met shortly after my
arrival in the city was Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who
was in Constantinople as Britain's special envoy to
negotiate a convention regarding the withdrawal of
British troops from Egypt. He had a suite at our hotel
where we saw each other frequently and became very
good friends. Drummond Wolff, as he was usually
spoken of to distinguish him from the several other
prominent Wolffs, was certainly a remarkable and clever
man, and a great <i>raconteur</i>. He was then in his late
fifties, had had wide experience as a diplomat, and was
thoroughly familiar with the Turkish temperament. In
fact, he was at home in all that part of the world. He
was born in Malta, the son of the famous missionary,
Rev. Joseph Wolff, a Jew who became a convert first to
Catholicism and then to Episcopalianism, being ordained
as priest in the Church of England. While in America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the
College of St. John's, Annapolis, Maryland.</p>

<p>Sir Henry advised me in dealing with the Turkish
authorities always to be patient, pleasant, persistent.
He also impressed upon me the importance of maintaining
the most cordial relations with my colleagues and of
returning all hospitalities; that a well-disposed colleague
can often be of incalculable assistance in inducing the
authorities to accede to any proper demand one might
have to make. However, his own relations with the
British ambassador, Sir William White, were not so
friendly. The estrangement between them was quite
evident, caused no doubt by personal jealousy, which is
so likely to result between a special envoy and the regularly
accredited representative of the same country in a
given territory.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Royal only about ten days, and then
moved to summer quarters in a hotel at Therapia, a
name given to the district some three thousand years ago
by the Greeks because of its healthful and balmy climate.
Here, too, Drummond Wolff had a neighboring suite,
and later, when by reason of a longer stay than anticipated
he was obliged to give up his apartment before he
was ready, we put a portion of ours at his disposal, which
he much appreciated. It was a very pleasant arrangement,
and diplomatically no less profitable. We dined
together every evening, and often in our party were also
Prince Ghika, Roumanian chargé, and the Princess;
Baron Van Tetz, Dutch minister, and the Baroness.
The Baron was later accredited to Berlin, and then
made Minister of Foreign Affairs in his own country.
He has now retired and at this writing he and the Baroness
still live at The Hague. They are charming people.</p>

<p>On June 21, 1887, the entire diplomatic corps was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
present in official dress at services in the English chapel,
in honor of the Queen's Jubilee. The chaplain of the
English embassy, the Reverend George Washington,
officiated. He said he was of the same family as our own
George Washington.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The day before my audience I presided at the commencement
exercises of Robert College at Roumeli-Hissar,
by invitation of the venerable president, Dr.
George Washburn. The college in 1887 had about one
hundred and eighty students, mainly Bulgarians, Greeks,
and Armenians, with two or three Turks. The commencement
was quite similar to those at home, except
that the orations were delivered in the various languages
of the East as well as in French and English.</p>

<p>I took this first occasion to refer in a larger way to the
aims and purposes of Robert College and similar American
institutions. The Turks had not been able to understand
the benevolence that prompted the establishment
of schools and colleges by Americans throughout the
empire. They were suspicious, and their attitude was
founded on experiences with various institutions and
societies of several of the other nations, notably the
Greeks, who, under guise of scientific and benevolent
activity, had fostered political design. The Turks believed
that behind our institutions lay a purpose inimical
to the sovereignty of Turkey, a belief stimulated by
Russia and by some of the French Catholics, who were
opposed to the extended use of the English language and
the influence of Protestant English and American ideas
in the East. This gave rise to many of the vexatious questions
that the legation had to solve. By way of throwing
some oil upon these troubled waters, therefore, I said,
during my address:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>For centuries the tide of progress and civilization has been
making its way toward the West. Its course has been marked
by blood and carnage. The history of the Middle Ages and of
modern times chronicles the nations and empires that have
sunk in this mighty current, and the new life and new civilization
that have sprung up over the ruins of the old. That flood
tide, pushing its irresistible course onward, still swept on, until
in our day it mingled its waters with the Great Pacific Ocean.
The Ultima Thule having at last been reached, the great ebb-tide
began to course its way backward; and America, the
youngest of nations, in gratitude for all the past, as a token of
her amity and her friendship, has sent back on the advance
current of this return tide not ships of war nor armed troops,
but her most cherished institutions, a fully equipped American
college.</p>

<p>So that here, to-day, on the beautiful and picturesque shores
of the classic Bosphorus, on the very spot where the nations of
the East four and a half centuries ago erected and left the well-preserved
monument of their passage to the West, stands
Robert College. What a tale and what a history! Robert
College here and the Towers of Roumeli-Hissar there! The
one the fortified remains of bygone wars, the other the tranquil
emblem of returning peace. What a double tale do these two
institutions speak to one another! The tie that unites them is
one of love and peace, a league more puissant than army or
navy for the welfare and happiness of nations. When centuries
shall have rolled by and another Gibbon shall come to write
of empires, may it be his privilege to record no longer the
decline and fall, but the rise and rejuvenation of this Orient
to which we look with affection.</p></blockquote>

<p>And now that I had been received and entertained by
about everybody in Constantinople, it was time for my
audience with the Sultan, who came last like the prima
donna. Official functions at Yildis Palace, as the Sultan's
residence is called (Yildis meaning star), were always
most dignified and punctilious. Royal carriages were
sent from the Palace with escorts for myself and staff.
At the entrance to the Palace we were met by the Introducer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of Ambassadors; then we proceeded to the salon of
the Grand Master of Ceremonies, where I was met by
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and conducted by Osman
Pasha, Grand Marshal, into the presence of His Majesty.</p>

<p>The Sultan was standing ready to receive me. He was
a small man, of rather spare frame, sallow complexion,
dark eyes that sparkled with a furtive expression, prominent
aquiline nose, and short full black beard which
later, when it turned gray, he dyed reddish with henna.
He had on a black frock coat that buttoned to the neck.</p>

<p>According to custom I handed him the letters of recall
of my predecessor, then presented my credentials, and
made a brief address, a copy of which in writing I left
with him. It read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>The President of the United States has been pleased to
charge me with the distinguished honor and agreeable duty of
cultivating to the fullest extent the friendship which has so
happily subsisted between the two Governments, and of conveying
to Your Imperial Majesty the assurances of his best
wishes for the welfare of Your Imperial Majesty and for the
prosperity of Turkey.</p>

<p>As the faithful representative of my Government, charged
with the duty of protecting the interests of her citizens, permit
me to express the hope that Your Imperial Majesty's Government
will lend me its kindly aid in the efforts I shall at all
times make to maintain and further cement a good understanding
for the development of the relations of amity and
friendship between the two Governments, and that the same
courtesy and cordiality may be shown me which were so generously
accorded to my honored predecessors.</p>

<p>The time has at last come, through the progress of science,
when all nations by reason of the facility and rapidity of communication
have been brought nearer together, so that their
mutual interests and relations verily entitle them to be called
one great family.</p>

<p>In the spirit of that relationship I have come to dwell near
the Government of Your Imperial Majesty, and to greet you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in behalf of and in the words of our Chief Magistrate as his
"Great and Good Friend," with the hope "that God may have
Your Imperial Majesty in His wise keeping."</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is the customary language of such documents, with
the exception of the third paragraph. His Majesty replied
in a brief address, expressing his pleasure in receiving
me. He then sat down and bade me do likewise,
whereupon we were served with cigarettes and Turkish
coffee, the latter in egg-shaped cups resting in jewel-studded
holders. The Sultan speaks only Turkish, and
I spoke English, so we understood one another by means
of the dragoman, Mr. Gargiulo, who had been for twenty
years the very able Turkish adviser and interpreter of
the legation and remained at that post for ten years
thereafter.</p>

<p>The audience concluded, we returned to the legation in
the same stately fashion we had come, following which
we gave a reception to the American colony, composed
almost exclusively of the missionaries resident in Constantinople,
together with the president and faculty of
Robert College and of the Home School for Girls, then
located at Scutari, across the Bosphorus. I was now
ready for the official business of my mission.</p>

<p>For several years the Turks had been very jealous
of foreigners, especially in Asia Minor, and the result
was many restrictions which manifested themselves in
a variety of relations. The growth of the mission schools
and their increase in number quite naturally enhanced
the suspicion of the authorities, with the help, as I have
mentioned, of those whose interests were served in helping
the Turks to see danger in this growth of our institutions.</p>

<p>At the legation the interests of the American missionaries
with regard to their schools and their printed matter
formed the major portion of the affairs requiring my
immediate attention. About four hundred schools had
been established in Turkey by the Presbyterian and
Congregational missionary boards. Beginning with the
winter of 1885, upon one pretext or another, thirty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
these schools in Syria were closed, many of the teachers
arrested and forbidden ever to teach in the country
again, while the parents were threatened with fine and
imprisonment if they continued to send their children to
American schools. With few exceptions all the teachers
and parents were natives and Turkish subjects. The
official reason given for the closing of these schools was
that their boards had not complied with the Turkish law
requiring that textbooks, curriculums, and certificates of
the teachers be submitted to the authorities for examination;
although the missionary representatives gave
assurance that these requirements had been met.</p>

<p>Soon after my audience with the Sultan I took up the
subject of these schools with the Grand Vizier, Kiamil
Pasha, who was perhaps the most enlightened statesman
of the Turkish Empire. Mr. King, while acting chargé,
had made an agreement with the Minister of Public
Instruction whereby the missionaries at these schools
were to submit the textbooks and other documentary
equipment to the local authorities. I protested to the
Grand Vizier against the closing of the schools, and after
some weeks we reached an understanding: he was to telegraph
the vali or governor-general at Syria that the
schools were to be allowed to reopen upon their compliance
with the law, according to an arrangement between
himself and myself. The outcome looked hopeful, though
months dragged along without further result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and quite by accident, I learned that the
Porte had formulated proposed additional regulations
concerning all foreign schools, and that these regulations
were about to be submitted to the Council of Ministers
to be made law. I immediately requested a copy from
the Grand Vizier. I found, to my surprise, that the
regulations were calculated to place insuperable obstacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in the way of every foreign school in the empire. Among
other things, in addition to the requirement that textbooks,
curriculums, and teachers' certificates be submitted
for examination, all schools were to obtain an
iradé or express sanction of the Sultan in order to function.
Failing to receive that iradé within six months from
the date of the law embodying the new regulations, the
authorities in the several provinces were commanded to
close such schools.</p>

<p>I communicated my discovery to those of my colleagues
who were interested with me in this dispute:
Count de Montebello, French ambassador; Baron Blanc,
Italian ambassador; and Sir William White, British
ambassador. At the same time I submitted copies of the
proposed regulations to the Reverend Doctor Isaac Bliss
and the Reverend Henry O. Dwight, of the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Western
Turkey. They all viewed the matter as I did.</p>

<p>The following day I again called on the Grand Vizier,
informing him that I looked upon these regulations as
seriously infringing upon the rights of American citizens
in Turkey, and pointing out my objections in detail.
The three colleagues just referred to did the same on
behalf of their respective subjects who had mission or
other schools in the empire. We succeeded in impressing
the Grand Vizier with the force and validity of our objections,
for he requested us to put them in writing and
forward them to the Porte. With the aid of Drs. Bliss
and Dwight I prepared such a document, and I am glad
to be able to say that our protests came in time and were
sufficiently forceful to prove effective in preventing this
new legislation.</p>

<p>As I had now been negotiating for several months with
reference to the Syrian schools, I decided that the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
efficient way of translating into concrete result the
repeated promises in regard to them was to visit some of
our missionary schools throughout the empire. I obtained
the necessary permission from Washington and took a
journey to Cairo, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Beirut, Mersina, and
Smyrna, where I conferred with our missionaries, with our
several consuls, as well as with the respective governors
and governor-generals. I found the relations between
the local authorities and our consuls, and between
the authorities and the missionary representatives,
quite friendly, in some places indifferent, but nowhere
hostile.</p>

<p>I had instructed the missionaries to get ready for the
opening of the schools, and I planned the trip so as to
be in Beirut about the time my order for the reopening
was to be put in force. My plan had the desired effect.
In anticipation of my arrival at Beirut, fifteen of the
schools were reopened; and while I was there five or six
more. That was about as many of the total thirty as the
missionaries cared to or were in a position to reopen
then. For the time being I felt satisfied that I had sufficiently
reversed the Government policy to check the progressive
closing of the schools which, if continued, would
seriously have threatened the existence of all American
schools in Turkey.</p>

<p>I must here express my appreciation of the assistance
given me by Erhard Bissinger, our consul at Beirut. He
was an earnest, sincere man, formerly a New York merchant.
Although his health was frail he worked with
unremitting zeal and efficiency, discharging his official
duties with rare judgment and tact. I could always rely
on the correctness of his reports respecting the many
difficulties as they arose, and I could always feel assured
that in each instance he would apply every effort to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
about an adjustment with the local authorities, by whom
he was as highly esteemed as by the missionaries.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another expression of the Government's enmity toward
the activities of our missionaries was the treatment being
accorded the colporteurs, or persons who went about
selling Bible tracts. The agents of the American as well
as the British Bible Society were constantly and arbitrarily
being arrested. They were charged with plying
their trade without license, yet when they made application
they were never able to get license. From time to
time I protested against these arrests and secured the
release of one after another of the agents; but the thing
to be done was to prevent arrests.</p>

<p>The fact was they were being made without real cause.
Before these tracts or any other material could be printed
a permit had to be obtained from the Ottoman Government.
The material had to pass censorship before it was
allowed to be printed, so that the very fact of its appearing
in print was proof of the authorization of the censors.
I held that, once printed, to prohibit the sale of these
tracts was in restraint of commerce; that there was no
reason why book hawkers should be under different regulations
from hawkers of any other wares.</p>

<p>I prepared an argument along these lines, which I
presented to the Grand Vizier, and he agreed with my
conclusions. He forthwith gave orders for the release of
all colporteurs and that no further arrests were to be
made. The British Bible Society, of course, benefited
equally with our own by these orders, and I received their
grateful appreciation through my colleague, Sir William White.</p>

<p>All this hostility toward the missionaries and their
work might be construed to be founded upon an objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
by the Government to having its subjects converted to
Christianity. But it was rather foreign influence as a
whole that was being fought, and religion was simply the
convenient peg. Conversions from Mohammedanism
were few and far between, and for the number of Mohammedans
turned Christian in the course of a year there
were as many Christians turned Mohammedan. The
Mohammedans are intensely and sincerely devoted to
their faith. On the whole they are convinced that their
religion is the only true one and that Christianity is
inferior and less rational. Such converts as the missionaries
do make come almost exclusively from among
the Armenians, Syrians, Greeks, Maronites, and other
Christian sects whose form of Christianity is of a mediæval
character. The chief missionary work in Turkey is
educational, carried forward in a religious spirit. At the
time of my visit to the various vilayets, the Presbyterian
Board alone had over one hundred schools throughout
Syria, all located in places where previously there had
been no schools at all.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Many of the men who carried forward missionary
work had consecrated their whole lives to it. Chief among
these were Rev. Henry H. Jessup, venerable patriarch of
the Presbyterian missionaries; Rev. Daniel Bliss, president
of the Syrian Protestant College; and Dr. George
Washburn, president of Robert College.</p>

<p>Dr. Jessup and Dr. Bliss had started for the field together
in 1856, when, in bleak December, they both left
Boston in the sailing vessel Sultana, which, according
to Dr. Jessup's autobiography, "Fifty-Three Years in
Syria," carried in addition to nine or ten missionaries a
cargo of New England rum to Smyrna&mdash;a cargo spirited
no less than spiritual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>Dr. Bliss was succeeded in 1902 by his distinguished
son, Rev. Howard S. Bliss, who conducted with renewed
vigor the work of his father, enlarging the scope and curriculum
of the college so that through its thousands of
graduates in the arts, in science, and in medicine it became
a potent force throughout the whole Near East.
During my subsequent missions to Turkey I became very
intimate with the younger Bliss, and during the Peace
Conference in 1919, when he was in Paris in behalf of
Syria, I was able to continue this intimacy. Unfortunately
in Paris he was already suffering from a serious
malady which resulted in his death in America the year
following. He was honored, respected, and beloved in
both the old world and the new.</p>

<p>Dr. Washburn was a man of statesmanship as well as
erudition. His book of recollections, "Fifty Years in
Constantinople," is valuable for the light it throws on
political issues in Turkey no less than on questions educational
and religious. He was recognized as an authority
on Turkish and Balkan affairs, and the influence of
the college was by no means limited to the Turkish Empire;
it was felt quite as much throughout the Balkan
States. Bulgaria at one period was largely governed by
officials who had been graduated from Robert College,
and they looked to Dr. Washburn as their chief adviser.
The British ambassador at Constantinople frequently
consulted him and was swayed by his advice, for Dr.
Washburn understood the Turks and spoke their language.
He was the second president of the college, having
succeeded his father-in-law, the Reverend Cyrus Hamlin,
D.D.</p>

<p>On the faculty of Robert College were a number of
other very able men: Dr. Albert L. Long, Professor of
Natural Science, distinguished as an archæologist as well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
was a man of engaging personality. He had a large acquaintance
among the learned Turks, whose estimate of
our country was materially influenced for the good by
their association with him. Then there was Dr. Edwin A.
Grosvenor, Professor of Latin and History, who resigned
shortly afterward to accept a professorship at Amherst.
He was then at work on his scholarly "History of Constantinople,"
which I consider the best and most reliable
work on that subject.</p>

<p>In 1888 I secured for Robert College, after arduous
negotiation, permission for the erection of two new buildings,
one a house for the president and the other an addition
to the college itself. When the permits came through
there was no mention of the addition to the college, and
as work on it meanwhile had been begun, no little anxiety
ensued. It developed that some one on the staff of the
Grand Vizier had been bribed by an enemy of the college
to tamper with the permits. However, because of the
good relationship between Kiamil Pasha and myself, he
acknowledged this bit of chicanery and duly rectified it.</p>

<p>I might add that in numerous instances I was able to
arrange unofficially with the Grand Vizier matters which
threatened to become more or less troublesome. This
method of negotiating was peculiarly advantageous at
the Porte, where delays were proverbial and so frequently
defeated official action. Again, some of the difficulty experienced
by my colleagues in getting proper redress for
violations, even gross violations, was due to the fact that
the Porte was not always able to control the governor-generals
of the provinces.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have said that my trip among our missionary schools
included a visit to Cairo. At that time Egypt was still
under Turkish sovereignty and questions of larger importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
had to be taken up with the Sublime Porte. Thus
American questions came under my jurisdiction as envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the empire.
Our representative at Cairo, John Cardwell, had the title
of consul-general and diplomatic agent, and had to receive
his exequatur from the Sublime Porte. He was
a conscientious and capable official who had been there
since the beginning of the first Cleveland Administration.</p>

<p>On this trip also I saw much of Anthony M. Keiley and
his charming wife; I have spoken of him in a previous
chapter as having been rejected for the post of United
States minister by Austria-Hungary. Keiley was serving
as one of the American judges of the Mixed or Reform
Tribunal at Cairo and was highly respected for his ability
at this international court.</p>

<p>Mohammed Tewfik, son of the extravagant Ismail of
Suez Canal fame, whom he succeeded, was Khedive of
Egypt and entertained us during our visit. He was only
thirty-six years old, and without his fez might have been
taken for an Englishman. He spoke fluent English and
his conversation showed him to be well informed regarding
the governments and peoples of Europe. Within an
hour after my first call upon him he called with his aide-de-camp
upon me at the Hotel Shepheard. He wanted to
decorate me, but I informed his aide that under our system
we did not permit diplomatic representatives to accept
such distinctions; so the next day he sent a lesser
decoration to the manager of the hotel, which, it was said,
he did in my honor.</p>

<p>A few days later we were invited to lunch with him,
and there were also present a number of higher officials.
The menu consisted of dishes with such improvised
names as "crevettes à l'Américaine," "bombe à la Lincoln,"
etc. One dish that made a deep impression upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
my none-too-keen gastronomic memory was the delicious
Egyptian quail, which is larger and plumper than our
own. In season the birds migrate from the north and
are trapped in great numbers. They could be bought in
the markets for a piaster, or less than five cents.</p>

<p>I had frequent conferences with Nubar Pasha, Egypt's
foremost statesman. He was an Armenian educated by
Jesuits in France. His knowledge was extensive, and he
combined the enlightened viewpoint of a European
statesman of the first rank with all the subtlety of an
Oriental. It was he who conceived the plan of introducing
a legal system and good government in Egypt, and
creating the mixed tribunals or international law courts.
In the reorganization of Egypt he acted in sympathy
with Lord Dufferin's programme and consequently was
highly regarded by the British.</p>

<p>With Sir Evelyn Baring, British agent and consul-general
in Egypt, afterwards Lord Cromer, I had a pleasant
conversation. He was then at the height of his power
in the reconstruction of Egypt. Major-General Sir Francis
Grenfell, sirdar or commanding general of the Egyptian
army, is another memory in connection with that
visit.</p>

<p>I regretted that time did not permit my going up the
Nile; but like every one with an historical imagination I
was immensely impressed with the grandeur and massive
beauty of the pyramids and the classic ruins of ancient
Egypt, which with their five thousand or more years of
existence have outdistanced all other relics in bringing
the handiwork of man down through ages of devastating
time.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There was a matter pending at Jerusalem regarding
which our Secretary of State had instructed me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
which I thought best to look into personally while on this
trip. Foreign Jews were being expelled simply because
of their race, and American Jews were being discriminated
against along with those of other nations. In the
background of this action by Turkey were Russia and
Roumania, for since the days of the Spanish Inquisition
the Ottoman authorities, with rare exceptions, had been
not only tolerant but hospitable to Jewish immigrants.
Roumania, contrary to express provisions of the Treaty
of Berlin guaranteeing equal political and civil rights to
all subjects in this newly created principality, placed restrictions
upon her Jewish subjects, causing a large number
to emigrate. And from Russia, following the enforcement
of the Ignatieff laws of 1882 (some of them laws
that had been on the statute books unenforced for
years), there was also a wholesale exodus of persecuted
Jews. Most of these people went to America, but some to
other countries, including Palestine.</p>

<p>It was the irony of persecution that the Russians who
came to Turkey were claimed as subjects by Russia,
which entered a protest at the Porte against making them
Ottoman subjects. On the other hand, the Russian Patriarch
in Turkey and the dignitaries of the Roman Church
objected to the settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine.
This pressure from powers that Turkey wished to please
brought forth the promulgation of a law interdicting all
Jews from coming to Palestine for permanent residence.
Besides those from Russia and Roumania, there were a few
Jews coming from England and France. And there were
a very few coming from America&mdash;naturalized citizens.</p>

<p>At the Porte I had taken this matter up with the Grand
Vizier. He told me that a regulation was communicated
to the Imperial authorities at Jerusalem limiting the stay
of foreign Jews there to one month. Later he told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that the Council of Ministers was about to change this
limit to three months. He gave as reasons for the existence
of any such regulations, first, that at certain times
of the year, Easter, for example, religious fanaticism was
at so high a pitch that Jews had to remain in their houses
to escape attack and perhaps murder at the hands of the
Christians. In the second place, it had been reported that
the Jews of all the world were planning to strengthen
themselves in and around Jerusalem with a view to re-establishing
their ancient kingdom at some future time.</p>

<p>I answered that of course the first reason could be done
away with by a strong force of police. As for the second,
if the Porte would make inquiry it could satisfy itself
that there was no such plan among the Jews of the world,
that the immigration was caused by the persecution in
Russia and Roumania. (This was nine years before
the publication of the pamphlet, in 1896, by Dr. Hertzl,
from which generated modern Zionism. I shall speak of
Dr. Hertzl later.) So far as the American Jews were concerned,
I informed the Grand Vizier that it was a fundamental
principle of our Government to make no distinction
of race or creed among our citizens, and that we had
consistently denied to foreign nations that right over our
citizens, as the provisions in our treaties with the Ottoman
Empire showed. To all of this the Grand Vizier
replied simply that should any American be expelled he
would carefully consider my arguments and give instructions
accordingly.</p>

<p>On communicating with our consul-general at Jerusalem,
Henry Gillman, I learned that he had taken the
same position, and that to date no American citizen had
been expelled; also that the American consulate was the
only one which had refused aid to the authorities in the
expulsion of foreign Jews, and our representative was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
being made very comfortable for this non-coöperation
with the local government. Here the matter stood when
I left Constantinople.</p>

<p>There were a number of other vexatious questions
pending between the vali at Jerusalem and Mr. Gillman,
and I deemed it good policy to show my resentment to
the vali for his arbitrary methods. I declined the courtesy
of the official conveyance with which he sent one of his
aides to Jaffa to meet me and my family and take us to
Jerusalem. We took a Cook's conveyance, stopped overnight
at Ramleh, and next day drove over the hills of
Judea to Jerusalem, where Mr. Gillman conducted us to
comfortable quarters at a hotel outside the walls.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Scarcely had I arrived at the hotel when a huge delegation
of Jews, men and women, some with infants in their
arms, came to plead with me to obtain the release of relatives
and friends who had been put in prison by the vali
or governor because they had come to settle there. I had
known of the troubled conditions in Jerusalem because
of the immigration of the Jews; but until my arrival there
I was not aware of the imprisonment of these people.
More than four hundred of them were being held in prison
awaiting deportation.</p>

<p>Instead of calling on the vali as ordinarily would have
been proper, I sent a note to him through the consul demanding
the immediate release of the immigrants who,
I claimed, were being imprisoned contrary to our treaty
as well as the treaties of Great Britain, France, and other
powers; I said that I should decline to call upon him
until this injustice was righted by such release; and that,
further, unless my request was promptly complied with I
should appeal to the Sublime Porte for his removal.</p>

<p>I felt authorized to take so drastic a step by reason of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the negotiations I had had with the Grand Vizier and in
view of our treaty and the treaties of several of the powers
I have referred to. I obtained the desired result. The vali
communicated my message to the Porte, and the Grand
Vizier instructed him to comply with my request. Within
twenty-four hours all the prisoners were released.</p>

<p>The following morning there was a delegation of several
thousand people outside my hotel, who had come to express
their gratitude. They presented me with a beautifully
embossed memorial, the text of which, translated,
reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>With delight of soul we bring to thee, O Sir, glory of our people,
the blessing of our community, the congregations of Israel
dwelling in Zion and in all the cities of the Holy Land,</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">
THE BLESSING OF MAZZOL TOV<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">(good fortune)</span>
</p>

<blockquote><p>because the Lord God of Israel has raised thee to fame and
glory and has given to thee a seat of honor among the mighty of
the earth. And we lift our hands to the Holy Sanctuary (praying)
that thy horn be exalted with honor and splendor, and
that thou be given the strength and the power to exalt the
horn of Israel, thy people, to speak in their favor before the
throne of the Government&mdash;may its glory increase!&mdash;and
that thou continue in thy honored office for many days, until
he (the messiah) shall come unto Shiloh "and unto him shall the
obedience of the people be"&mdash;soon, in our days, amen!</p>

<p>Such is the blessing of those who respect and honor thee in
accordance with thy high and exalted station.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem&mdash;may it be built and
established in our days!</p></blockquote>

<p>It is signed with the seals and signatures of Rafail Meir
Panisel (Haham Bashi), chief rabbi of the Spanish and
Portuguese Jews in Jerusalem, and Samuel Salant, chief
rabbi of the Ashkenazim, Perushim, and Hasidim in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Now I called upon the vali, who received me very graciously
and with great courtesy. I thanked him for his
prompt compliance with my request, and expressed the
hope that, inasmuch as I had an understanding with the
Porte that no discrimination was to be made against Jewish
immigrants to Jerusalem, I should not in future have
to complain of any infringement upon this understanding,
otherwise I should again be compelled to take drastic
action. I called his attention to the treaties referred to,
of which he had had no previous knowledge.</p>

<p>I stopped to make some official calls, accompanied by
the consul and his staff. As is customary when high officials
go through the streets of the Holy City, several halberdiers
of the vali preceded, to give distinction to the
party as well as protection and a clear passage through
the crowds. I could remain in Jerusalem only three or
four days, however, for I had to catch the steamer that
stopped at Alexandretta and Smyrna, where I wanted to
confer with our consuls.</p>

<p>Upon my return to Constantinople my French and
British colleagues were much pleased at my having secured
the release of the Jewish immigrants in Palestine.
They had received, through their foreign offices, expressions
of appreciation and grateful acknowledgment from
such organizations as the Anglo-Jewish Association of
London, and the Alliance Israélite of Paris.</p>

<span class="caption">TESTIMONIAL GIVEN TO MR. STRAUS IN JERUSALEM IN APPRECIATION OF THE RELEASE OF
SEVERAL HUNDRED PRISONERS</span>
</div>

<p>The next step in the development of this question was
a communication received by our State Department from
Mavroyeni Bey, Turkish minister at Washington, informing
the Department of a change, indeed, of the time
limit from one month to three for the sojourn of Jews in
Jerusalem, with the proviso, however, "that they are
going to Jerusalem in the performance of a pilgrimage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and not for the purpose of engaging in commerce or taking
up their residence there."</p>

<p>This communication was received while I was on my
trip, and Secretary Bayard forwarded it to me with the
instruction that I take up the subject with the Ottoman
Government as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>To require of applicants for passports, which under our laws
are issued to all citizens upon the sole evidence of their citizenship,
any announcement of their religious faith or declaration
of their personal motives in seeking such passports, would be
utterly repugnant to the spirit of our institutions and to the
intent of the solemn proscription forever by the Constitution
of any religious test as a qualification of the relations of the
citizen to the Government, and would, moreover, assume an
inquisitorial function in respect of the personal affairs of the
individual, which this Government can not exert for its own
purposes, and could still less assume to exercise with the object
of aiding a foreign Government in the enforcement of an
objectionable and arbitrary discrimination against certain of
our citizens.</p>

<p>Our adherence to these principles has been unwavering since
the foundation of our Government, and you will be at no loss
to cite pertinent examples of our consistent defense of religious
liberty, which, as I said in my note to Baron Schaeffer of May
18, 1885, in relation to the Keiley episode at Vienna, "is the
chief corner-stone of the American system of Government, and
provisions for its security are embedded in the written charter
and interwoven in the moral fabric of its laws."</p></blockquote>

<p>I received this upon my return. Secretary Bayard
asked me also to ascertain the views of my colleagues
respecting this iradé, and I found them willing and ready
to take it up with the Porte in a manner similar to the
instructions I had received.</p>

<p>I called on Saïd Pasha and left with him a note in accordance
with my instructions, and I sent a copy of this
note to the French and British ambassadors. They in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
turn each advised the Ministry that they could not admit
of regulations prejudicial to the existing rights of their
subjects as secured by treaties. And here for a time the
matter rested.</p>

<p>Several months later three American Jews were expelled
from Jerusalem because they had not left the city
at the expiration of three months, and again the question
had to be taken up with the Porte. This time Saïd Pasha
replied that the restrictions with regard to the three
Americans had been ordered withdrawn, "the Sublime
Porte having lately decided that the measure concerning
the Israelites going to Palestine shall not be applied but
to those who emigrate in number (<i>en nombre</i>), and that no
obstacle shall be opposed to the sojourn of those who are
not in this class."</p>

<p>This, like most other questions that arose between the
Ottoman Government and our own, could not be settled
for any length of time by principle, law, or treaty. Such
documents might be used as reminders of agreements
once reached, but in Turkey they do not of themselves
direct policies or action. Drummond Wolff had advised
being "patient, pleasant, persistent," to which I would
add: eternally vigilant.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the whole, the interests of the United States
throughout the Ottoman Empire were peculiar, in that
the majority of the complaints related to personal, as
distinct from commercial, rights. I have said in an earlier
chapter that some of the questions at issue, especially
those involving extraterritoriality, grew out of capitulations
dating back over four hundred years, to the conquest
of Constantinople by the Moslems in 1453. The
terms of these capitulations or "privileges" were made
originally between the Greeks and the various Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
city republics&mdash;Pisa, Genoa, Venice. The Moslems
later embodied them in revised capitulations with France
in 1535, 1604, 1673, and 1740; with England in 1583 and
1675; with Holland in 1680; with Austria in 1718; and
with Russia in 1783. On these later European capitulations
was based our own first treaty with the Sublime
Porte in 1830. Practically speaking, therefore, consular
jurisdiction in Turkey was then not very different from
what it was in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>When I took office one of the vexatious questions to be
settled was the interpretation of Clause IV of the Treaty
of 1830. This treaty was negotiated by Charles Rhind,
as American commissioner, with Reis Effendi, Turkish
representative. Rhind had prepared it, with the help of
dragoman Navoni, in French and in Turkish, and when
it was finally drawn up, according to Rhind's own report,
Reis Effendi "signed and sealed the treaty in Turkish and
I did the same with the French translation, and we exchanged
them." Thereupon the original Turkish version,
together with a copy of the French translation as signed
by the American commissioners&mdash;President Jackson
had appointed Captain James Biddle and David Offley
together with Rhind&mdash;and several English translations
were transmitted to Washington. The treaty actually
approved by the Senate was one of the English versions.</p>

<p>Before the ratifications were exchanged the American
chargé d'affaires at Constantinople, David Porter, received
word that the French version was not exactly in
agreement with the Turkish. Porter's simple method of
correcting this discrepancy was to sign a document, also
in the Turkish language, accepting the Turkish version of
the treaty without reserve; and when the translation of
this document reached Washington nothing further was said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Indeed, the treaty rested in peace until 1868, when the
American minister, acting according to the English version,
clashed with the Turkish authorities in the interpretation
of Clause IV, regarding jurisdiction over American
citizens&mdash;in this case two who had been arrested and imprisoned
for alleged offenses against the Turkish Government.
The English version read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Citizens of the United States of America, quietly pursuing
their commerce, and not being charged or convicted of any
crime or offence, shall not be molested; and even when they
may have committed some offence they shall not be arrested
and put in prison, by the local authorities, but they shall be
tried by their Minister or Consul, and punished according to
their offence, following, in this respect, the usage observed
towards other Franks.</p></blockquote>

<p>When our Government proceeded to obtain exact
translations of this clause, it was found that the Turkish
version did not contain the words "arrested" or "tried,"
although the phraseology made clear that American citizens
were not to be imprisoned in Turkish prisons, but
punished through their minister or consul. Consequently,
the Turkish authorities could arrest but not imprison,
could try but not inflict punishment.</p>

<p>The Turkish Government would not recognize as accurate
any of the translations the United States presented.
When asked to present a translation of its own, however,
the matter was gradually put in abeyance.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In 1862 our minister, E. J. Morris, concluded another
treaty with the Porte, entitled, as was the first one, "A
Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," which, by its
Article XX, was to remain in force twenty-eight years
unless either party saw fit to abrogate at the end of fourteen
or twenty-one years. In January, 1874, the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Government gave notice to our Department of State of
its desire to terminate the treaty, following this notice
up with another communication to the same effect in
September, 1875. Although by the terms of the treaty
such notice was to be permissible not earlier than June,
1876, nothing was said in Washington regarding the untimeliness
of these communications, and in his Annual
Message of December, 1876, President Grant announced:
"Under this notice the treaty terminated upon the fifth
day of June 1876." President Cleveland, on the other
hand, in his first Annual Message nine years later, questioned
the official termination, but added: "As the commercial
rights of our citizens in Turkey come under the
favored-nation guarantee of the prior treaty of 1830 ...
no inconvenience can result" from our agreeing to the
abrogation. Thus questions of jurisdiction and commercial
rights were thrown back for settlement under the
Treaty of 1830, the translation of which was and has remained
in dispute.</p>

<p>Much of this confusion was due, again, to the slight
actual regard, on the part of the Ottoman Empire, for the
terms of treaties. In this attitude they had been encouraged
by some of the European nations&mdash;most of all
Russia in its more powerful days&mdash;who, in return for
other advantages, were not insistent upon their claims
under the capitulations, especially the claims of jurisdiction
over nationals. So far as concerned the United
States, this loose effectiveness of treaties caused constant
misunderstanding with regard to the handling of cases
arising under them.</p>

<p>With every question that came up under the disputed
Clause IV, for instance, the Turks would controvert the
right of our consuls to try, and we would insist on that
right. The battle then would be won after a fashion by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the side with the most persistence. During my administration
I happened to be the winner much of the time,
although my winning merely released a possibly innocent
person; for while we argued about a trial for the suspect
he lingered in jail, and after I got his release the Turks
would refuse to acknowledge our jurisdiction and not
prosecute. Innocent and guilty alike were made to suffer
in jail, and alike were set scot-free upon release. Not only
that, but whenever an American citizen committed, or
was alleged to have committed, a crime and was arrested
by the Turkish authorities, it created irritation and a
strain of our relationship.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The only other treaty then negotiated between the
Ottoman Government and our own&mdash;the Treaty of Naturalization
and Extradition&mdash;had also been a subject for
discussion and dispute ever since it was signed by Minister
George H. Boker in 1874. When it was concluded,
the Senate refused to confirm it because under it American
citizenship was forfeited <i>ipso facto</i> by the return of
the naturalized citizen to his native land and his remaining
there two years; but the Senate amended this treaty
by changing the phraseology of the clause containing
the two-year reference. The Sublime Porte accepted the
amendment by a declaration of what it understood to
be its intent and significance, which interpretation our
Government, in turn, would not accept.</p>

<p>And there that treaty was hung in 1875, although our
Government that year made an appropriation of ten
thousand eight hundred dollars for presents to Turkish
officials, which was then customary on concluding a
treaty with the Porte.</p>

<p>As the conditions which had called forth the treaty
continued to exist, I was instructed to renew negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in the matter. A number of Christian subjects of the
Porte&mdash;some Greeks and some Syrians, but principally
Armenians&mdash;in order to free themselves from Turkish
jurisdiction had fled to the United States. Here they
remained long enough to become citizens, and from time
to time they came back to Turkey, where they were
charged with being involved in alleged conspiracies
against the Turkish Government. Such cases arose frequently,
and it was felt that the Treaty of Naturalization
and Extradition with the two-year clause, similar to the
one we have with many other nations, would prevent citizens
of the Porte from using naturalization in America
as a means of escaping liability as subjects of Turkey
upon their return there.</p>

<p>I addressed myself to bringing about an adjustment of
these difficulties, either by securing a new treaty or
having the one of 1874 accepted as amended. A long
and tedious exchange of notes on the subject ensued.
Finally the Porte agreed to accept the Treaty of 1874 as
amended.</p>

<p>Of course I was elated, and the State Department was
pleased. That the treaty was one very much desired by
our Government was clear. I received a long, flattering
cable of congratulation from Mr. Bayard, and a letter in
similar vein from Mr. Adee, saying in part:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whatever may be the outcome of these negotiations, you are
to be congratulated without stint on having achieved a decided
diplomatic success by causing the Government of the Porte
to recede from the position which it took in 1875, with respect
to the Senate amendments, and to which it has so pertinaciously
adhered ever since, until you wrought a change of heart
and induced it to take a more rational view of the subject.
This makes it far easier for us to deal with the question now as
justice and equity and due respect for the rights and privileges
attaching to American nationality may demand.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>Then the bubble burst! Under my instructions I had
assured the Turkish authorities that with their acceptance
of the amendments of our Senate the negotiations
in the matter would be concluded, and all that would be
necessary to give effect to the treaty was the proclamation
of the President. Instead, however, it was thought
best again to submit the terms to the Senate, as fourteen
years had elapsed since the negotiation of the original
treaty. Thereupon some of our leading missionaries, at
the instigation of prominent Armenians who had been
naturalized in America and returned to Turkey, opposed
ratification, and no further action was taken. It was a
very discouraging situation, for many annoying cases
constantly came up, some of a rather serious nature.</p>

<p>I might add that ten years later, when I was again
minister to Turkey, I was instructed to renew negotiations,
but the Ottoman Government was now unwilling
to negotiate at all on this subject, and we were left without
any treaty of naturalization.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There were one or two interesting special matters
that came up during this mission. Toward the end of
1887 Baron Maurice de Hirsch came to Constantinople
to adjust some financial differences with the Turkish
Government. His railway, connecting Constantinople
with European cities, was about completed. The Turkish
Government claimed that he owed it 132,000,000 francs,
a claim growing out of kilometric guarantees and other
concessions.</p>

<p>One day while I was calling on the Grand Vizier,
Kiamil Pasha, he asked to introduce some one to me, and
forthwith I met a tall and slender man in his fifties, dark
eyes sparkling with spirit and energy, clean-shaven except
for a full black mustache, dressed rather dudishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in a cutaway coat, white vest and white spats&mdash;Baron
de Hirsch. I was glad of this opportunity, for I had often
heard of him and his great philanthropic activities. We
had a pleasant conversation about things in general.</p>

<p>A few days later I took dinner with the Sultan. He
spoke to me about Baron de Hirsch and the claim of
Turkey against him. The Turkish Government was hard-pressed
for funds&mdash;its chronic condition. The Sultan
explained that for some time efforts had been made to
arrive at some settlement, and that it was now proposed
to arbitrate. The Baron had suggested first the French
and then the Austrian ambassador as arbitrator, but
neither was satisfactory to His Majesty; he, however,
had much confidence in my judgment and impartiality,
so that he had counter-suggested my name to the Baron,
which was satisfactory to the latter; and they had agreed
to pay me an honorarium of one million francs.</p>

<p>I assured the Sultan that I was much complimented
by his request, but I would have to consult the Secretary
of State. He told me he had already requested the Turkish
minister at Washington to inquire the views of the
Department, and that Mr. Bayard had said there was no
objection to my acting as arbitrator. But I said I would
have to communicate with Mr. Bayard personally and
would let His Majesty hear from me in the course of a
few days.</p>

<p>I cabled Mr. Bayard and learned, as the Sultan had
said, that there was no objection to my acceding to the
latter's wishes and accepting the honorarium if it appeared
to me advisable. Upon giving the proposal careful
consideration, however, I felt it would not be wise for me
to comply with the Sultan's request, much as I should
have liked to please him. Any transaction with the Turkish
Government involving money was open to suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of improper methods and bribery. Had I as arbitrator
made a decision disappointing to the Turkish Government,
I should certainly have fallen under such suspicion,
and I deemed it improper to assume an obligation which
might throw the American legation into a false light.</p>

<p>I advised Secretary Bayard accordingly and frankly
told the Sultan I could not accept. I added, however,
that while I would not accept an honorarium, I should be
glad to act as mediator to see whether a satisfactory adjustment
could not be brought about between the Baron
and the Grand Vizier, which offer the Sultan accepted.</p>

<p>As the negotiations went forward, the Baron and the
Grand Vizier had frequent disagreements and altercations.
Each of them would come to me with his grievance,
and I would give my opinion and bring them together
again. Finally there arose a legal question, and this was
submitted to Professor Gneist, the famous German
authority on international law. Upon his decision the
Baron finally paid the Turkish Government 22,000,000 francs.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During these negotiations, which lasted several months,
an intimate friendship developed between the Baron and
his wife and Mrs. Straus and myself. They often took
family dinner with us. They were declining official invitations
because of the recent death of their only child,
Lucien. The Baroness was an exceptionally fine woman,
learned and able, whose principal aim in life seemed to
be to find ways of being most helpful to others. In the
quarters of the poor, both Jew and Gentile, her short,
trim figure, dressed in deep mourning, was familiar. Her
face had an attractively benign expression. A story regarding
her activities in connection with the construction
of her husband's railroad was characteristic of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>In a village near Constantinople a number of houses
belonging to the poor had to be torn down to make way
for the railway station. The work was to be done with the
understanding that the Turkish Government would compensate
these people, but evidently no such consideration
was forthcoming. A number of those thus dispossessed
came to the Baron to complain, but he answered that it
was the Government's responsibility, not his. On hearing
of this the Baroness informed her husband that she did
not propose to let the railroad cause unhappiness to
people, that it would probably be a long time before the
Government paid the compensation, if ever, and that
she insisted on paying these people out of her own
private fortune so they could at once build new houses
and be happy. Then and there she carried out that programme.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Baron spoke to me of his own benefactions and
said he purposed during his lifetime to devote his fortune
to benevolent causes. His philanthropy up to that time
had been bestowed mainly in Russia, but he was desirous
of doing something for the Russians who, because of the
oppression resultant from the Ignatieff laws, were emigrating
to America. They had been persecuted and were
poor, and he wanted to enable them to reëstablish themselves.</p>

<p>I was familiar with the conditions of these Russian
immigrants, because prior to my coming to Turkey I had
been in close relationship for several years with Michael
Heilprin, author of a number of scholarly works and one
of the chief editors of Appleton's Encyclopædia. He
worked untiringly on behalf of these new arrivals, collecting
money for them and aiding them personally in
numerous ways. I think his untimely death was due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
primarily to his generous expenditure of energy in this
way. I mentioned Heilprin to the Baron and said I would
write him for suggestions how best the immigrants might
be helped.</p>

<p>When I heard from Heilprin I forwarded the letter to
the Baron, together with a list of men who had done most
in the way of benevolent work for the Jews of New York.
Prominent on that list were Meyer S. Isaacs, president of
the United Hebrew Congregations; Jesse Seligman, president
of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum; Jacob H. Schiff,
who was connected with a number of our charitable enterprises;
and my brother Isidor. The Baron subsequently
communicated with Mr. Isaacs and some others, and out
of their arrangements grew the Baron de Hirsch Fund
and the Baron de Hirsch Trade School. Later the Baroness,
upon conferring with Mrs. Straus, endowed the
Clara de Hirsch Home for Working Girls.</p>

<p>Neither my wife nor I wish to claim any credit for the
founding of the de Hirsch benevolent institutions. We
were simply the medium through which these came into
being. We never even suggested the nature of them. We
only gave the requested information regarding the need
for such institutions.</p>

<p>But to come back to Constantinople and its railroads.
During 1888 the question of a railroad from Constantinople
to the Persian Gulf was much agitated, especially
by the Germans. The Grand Vizier several times brought
up the subject in conversation with me, asking me to help
him get in communication with some reliable American
railroad builders. He assured me that the Turkish
Government would give more favorable terms to a group
of Americans because the project would then be free from
the political complications that might ensue if a road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
through the heart of the empire were controlled by
Germany or any other European power.</p>

<p>William K. Vanderbilt was in Constantinople at the
time. He had arrived in his yacht, which was larger than
most yachts that came through the Dardanelles, so it was
stopped until I could procure for him a special permit
from the Sultan to proceed. At the Sultan's request, I
spoke to Vanderbilt about the railroad and introduced
him to the Grand Vizier. But he was on pleasure bent
and not inclined to take up the cares and burdens involved
in such an undertaking.</p>

<p>Of course it was apparent that if American capitalists
and railroad builders with their vast experience would
take up the construction of this road it would put tremendous
power and prestige into American hands. I
suggested that Carl Schurz and Henry Villard might be
the proper persons to undertake this gigantic work. Villard's
name had figured prominently in the completion of
the Northern Pacific; he was close to Schurz, and they
each enjoyed a high reputation. Soon thereafter the
Porte submitted the matter to a syndicate of German,
British, and French bankers, and the famous Bagdad
Railroad was not built by Americans.</p>

<p>Early in 1888 I received a letter from an old friend, the
Reverend William Hayes Ward, eminent Assyriologist
and scholarly editor of the "Independent," respecting an
expedition for excavating in Babylonia which the Reverend
John P. Peters, of the University of Pennsylvania,
contemplated. Under Dr. William Pepper, provost of the
university, Dr. Peters was organizing the Babylon Exploration
Fund, which would base its work on the recommendations
made in 1884-85 by the Wolfe expedition
headed by Dr. Ward himself. The Wolfe expedition,
financed by Miss Catherine L. Wolfe, of New York City,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had been limited to reconnoissance and exploration.
Shortly thereafter the subject was brought to my attention
officially by Mr. Adee, of the Department of State,
who wrote me:</p>

<blockquote><p>We find ourselves between two fires,&mdash;on one hand is the
Philadelphia organization under the lead of Dr. Peters, which
has the money, and on the other is the Johns Hopkins enterprise,
which has the most solid ballasting of Assyriological
talent, but, unfortunately, its dollars are limited. As the Johns
Hopkins people deposit all their collections in the National
Museum, Professor Langley feels kindly disposed towards
them.... We shall probably have to look to you as the <i>deus
ex machina</i> to prescribe a solution.</p></blockquote>

<p>I conferred unofficially with Hamdy Bey, director of
the Imperial Museum at Stamboul, himself a very competent
scientist and in charge of all excavations in Turkey,
who informed me fully regarding the Turkish law
governing excavations, among other things that a permit
for making them had to be obtained from the Ministry
of Public Instruction (and these permits were not easily
obtained); and that all objects discovered were the property
of the Turkish Government, the excavator being
permitted only moulds or drawings thereof, except possibly
in the case of certain duplicates.</p>

<p>To save time in the matter, I brought it before the
Grand Vizier, who promised support in laying the project
before His Majesty the Sultan, with the view possibly of
getting an iradé to export at least a portion, if not half,
of the objects discovered. I suggested to our State Department
that the University of Pennsylvania and Johns
Hopkins work together and operate as one body, so that
an iradé, should it be obtainable, might serve for the
benefit of all concerned.</p>

<p>While <i>en route</i> to the United States on a short leave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
absence I met Dr. Peters in London. He handed me a
letter of introduction from President Cleveland asking
my good offices. The proposed excavations interested
me very much, and I promised Dr. Peters I would give
the subject immediate attention upon returning to my
post. Meanwhile I instructed the chargé, Mr. King, how
to proceed in my absence.</p>

<p>Early in November when I got back to Constantinople
I asked for an audience with the Sultan to explain the
purposes of the exploration fund, the interest of the various
universities and scientific societies in it, adding that
I had received a personal letter from the President in
regard to it, and that if he would give the permit to excavate
it would meet with high appreciation in my country.</p>

<p>It was the custom for ministers, as distinct from ambassadors,
to dismount at the Palace gate and proceed to
the Palace on foot. For this occasion, however, orders had
been given for our coming in at the Palace door. Here I
was met by His Highness, the Grand Vizier; the Minister
of Foreign Affairs; and the Grand Master of Ceremonies.
After some fifteen minutes the Grand Vizier and the
Grand Master of Ceremonies ushered me into the presence
of His Majesty. A private audience took place,
wherein the Sultan seemed very affable indeed. He said
he was happy to welcome me back to my post and hoped
that Mrs. Straus and I had had a pleasant trip.</p>

<p>His Majesty then led the way to the brilliantly illuminated
dining-hall, where a military orchestra of about
thirty members was playing. I was seated at His Majesty's
right, with the dragoman next to me, and the
Grand Vizier was at the left; down both sides sat the
pashas, their breasts sparkling with diamond orders.
The dinner was served on gold and silver plates, and the
menu was excellent and not overburdened. The Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
conversed freely, cheerfully, and apparently without reserve.</p>

<p>After dinner we went with him to a play in the little
theater on the Palace grounds. At an opportune moment
between the acts, while His Majesty questioned me regarding
some matters in the United States, I referred to
the excavations, and to the fact that several representatives
of the universities were awaiting his decision. He
graciously stated that permission would be granted, and
it was given a very few days thereafter.</p>

<p>Though we were all somewhat disappointed because
the permit was more restricted than we had been led to
expect, it enabled Dr. Peters and his party to go ahead
with their work. Dr. Peters has left a full account of the
explorations and the objects discovered, some of them
dating back earlier than 4000 B.C., in his two volumes
entitled "Nippur," which form a lasting memorial to his
services in the cause of archæology.</p>

<p>Unfavorable as we thought the permit was, I was accused
by Theodore Bent, British archæologist, writing
in the "Contemporary Review," of bribing Hamdy Bey
to obtain a favorable firman. He himself had dug at
Thasos the previous year and had run into difficulties
with the Turkish authorities, resulting in the seizure of
his findings. He still felt revengeful toward Hamdy Bey,
and the knowledge of our negotiations for a permit afforded
him ground for a scurrilous attack on the director
of the museum, who was, nevertheless, a man of fine
character and high repute.</p>

<p>The fact really was that the Sultan felt somewhat
under obligations to me because of my services in another
matter. There were in the Ottoman Empire a million or
more Persians, mainly rug dealers. Many of them had
married Turkish women. The Sultan claimed that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a Persian in Turkey married a Turkish subject his nationality
followed that of his wife. The controversy had
gone so far that the Shah of Persia was about to recall
his ambassador, and they finally agreed to submit the
matter to me for decision.</p>

<p>I took the subject under advisement and wrote an opinion
in accordance with the universally accepted doctrine
of nationality under such conditions, namely, that upon
marriage nationality followed that of the husband. But
instead of rendering my decision, I advised the Sultan
what it would be and suggested that it would probably
make for better relationship if he would anticipate my
decision by agreeing with the Shah's contention. This
he appreciated. At the same time it relieved me from the
necessity of deciding against the sovereign to whom I was
accredited.</p>

<p>Of course the Shah's ambassador, Mohsin Khan, who
was practically viceroy in the Ottoman Empire, desired
to confer upon me Persia's decoration, the Lion and the
Sun, set in costly brilliants, and once more I had to explain
our custom in regard to such things. It is indeed a
wise provision of our Constitution which prohibits American
officials from accepting "any present, emolument,
office or title of any kind whatever" without the consent
of Congress.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The election of 1888 having resulted in a Republican
victory, I tendered my resignation to the new President
upon his taking office, as is customary for heads of missions
when there has been a change in the administration.
I was unofficially informed that numerous letters and
memorials had been received in Washington from individuals
and missionary and church bodies, asking that I be
retained at my post; Dr. Pepper, of the University of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Pennsylvania, and several other university heads also
joined in urging my retention. But I wrote Dr. Pepper
not to push the request, as I could no longer absent myself
from my private affairs. The main matters of difference
between the two Governments had been settled,
and I felt justified in resigning, even had Cleveland been
reëlected, for I could not afford to stay on except under
pressure of patriotic necessity.</p>

<p>The salary at the Porte barely covered my house rent.
I had secured the best available house with facilities for
entertaining and the returning of hospitalities, and, as I
have mentioned before, such functions are essential for
the proper relations with one's colleagues and the government
to which one is accredited. Besides, it is important
to be able to show to one's nationals the hospitality they
expect from their diplomatic representatives, especially
in the case of prominent visitors who bring letters from
high officials at home.</p>

<p>Again, "noblesse oblige" has its widest and most emphatic
application in diplomacy. Americans are supposed
to be rich, and if an American diplomat does not show
the usual hospitalities he is charged with penuriousness,
for it is understood that a man who is not able to live
according to his station would not be chosen to head a
mission. That his pay may be inadequate for the discharge
of his social duties is not generally known. When
I was in Washington during my leave of absence Mr.
Cleveland asked me how I got along on my salary, and
I told him then that I could have got along fairly well on
four times the amount, for I had spent between thirty-five
and forty thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p>A few days prior to leaving my post in June, 1889, I
again dined with the Sultan. I had often done so during
my stay, but this time he was especially gracious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
unreserved. He expressed great regret at my going, saying
that at no time during his reign had the relations of
our countries been more agreeable, and that he and his
minister had had every confidence in my candor and
fairness. What seemed to have impressed him most was
my handling of a large claim by an American which was
being urged through the legation. I carefully examined
this claim and found it to be justified neither in morals
nor in law, and I informed the Turkish Government
accordingly that I had withdrawn it. The Porte was not
accustomed to such fair treatment! Of course, ever afterward
when I presented a matter it was believed to be
justified.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Sultan held the government pretty firmly in his
own hands&mdash;too much so in fact&mdash;and kept himself
very well informed regarding all manner of things. On
this evening he said he had heard of the great disaster and
loss of lives caused by the Johnstown flood and he desired
to transmit through me two hundred pounds to be used
for relief work. I cabled the amount to the Secretary of
State on the following day and communicated to His
Majesty our Government's acknowledgment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Express grateful appreciation of the President and the
Government of the United States for the Sultan's generous
relief for flood sufferers.</p></blockquote>

<p>When it became known that I was about to leave my
post I received many communications expressing regret.
These were a great satisfaction, especially one beautiful
letter from the missionaries of Constantinople, signed by
Edwin E. Bliss, I. F. Pettibone, Joseph K. Greene, H.
S. Barnum, Charles A. S. Dwight, Henry O. Dwight, and
William G. Bliss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>After we had boarded the steamer to Varna, homeward
bound, a royal caïque&mdash;a rowboat of the graceful lines
of a Venetian gondola and manned by six oarsmen&mdash;came
alongside our ship and one of the Sultan's aides came
aboard to present to Mrs. Straus the highest order of the
Shefekat decoration, a star set in brilliants, with the
special request of His Majesty that she accept it as a
token of his esteem and regard. As the regulations prohibiting
me from accepting such honors did not apply to
my wife, she graciously accepted this parting gift from
Abdul Hamid.</p>

<p>And so farewell to Pera and the beautiful Bosphorus!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Had diplomacy been a career, nothing would have pleased
me more than to continue in such service of my country.
On the whole I cannot say that I advocate changing our
system as to a more permanent service for the heads of
missions. Our President is now unhampered to select
men who are best qualified to deal with the problems in
hand at the various posts. This is an advantage over a
system that tends to keep in office ministers and ambassadors
who are ill equipped to bring statesmanlike qualities
to their work, though they may be past-masters in
routine and social requirements. But it would be well if,
on a change of administration, removals of heads of missions
were the exception rather than the rule. Of course,
after four or eight years, the return of our diplomatic
chiefs from foreign fields to the various parts of our
country has the advantage of enabling these men, by
reason of their experience and standing, to inform and
in a measure guide public opinion on questions concerning
international affairs.</p>

<p>On my return to New York I reëntered business, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
continued to take a deep and active interest in public
affairs. I spent much of my spare time lecturing on public
questions and historical matters.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Waves of Russian-Jewish immigrants were pounding
our shores in the spring of 1891. In Russia, pogroms and
other forms of mob persecution had become so persistent
that refugees were arriving in pitiful droves at our ports.
Sinister circumstance had hurled them from one country
into another. Many had been compelled to abandon
their employment or even their own established businesses
in Russia, owing to the enforcement of the Ignatieff
laws and the consequent prohibitions, restrictions, and
persecutions.</p>

<p>Determined to make a strenuous protest, a small committee
was formed of prominent Jews from New York,
Cincinnati, and Chicago, to lay before President Harrison
the pitiable conditions day by day presented by the
arriving refugees, many of whom had been stripped of all
their possessions.</p>

<p>Our committee was headed by Jesse Seligman, and
among the others I recall Jacob H. Schiff, of New York,
and General Lewis Seasongood, of Cincinnati, besides
myself. The President listened to our story with sympathetic
interest, and then turned to me and asked what,
in the light of my international and diplomatic experience,
I thought should be done. I told him that we had a right
to remonstrate with any nation with which we were on
friendly terms, as we were with Russia, for committing an
unfriendly act if that nation by special laws forced groups
of its people, in pitiable condition, to seek refuge in
another country and that country our own.</p>

<p>The President agreed, but suggested that our Government
ought to have before it an official report or statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of facts. I replied that this could easily be obtained
by sending a competent commission to Russia to make
inquiry. Promptly Colonel John B. Weber, immigration
commissioner at Ellis Island, admirably qualified because
of his experience in office and his sympathetic interest,
together with Dr. Walter Kempster, a physician known
for his studies of the pathology of insanity, were sent
abroad to make an investigation and report. Their investigation
was thorough, and they embodied their findings
in a report that is a model of its kind. It was the first
authentic and official report on these Russian restrictions
and persecutions, and when published it aroused great
interest in all enlightened parts of Europe as well as at
home. The distinguished English historian, Lecky, refers
to it in his own work, "Democracy and Liberty."</p>

<p>George Jones, of the "New York Times," also had an
investigation and report made by his London correspondent,
Harold Frederic. These findings the "Times"
published as articles and syndicated them to several other
papers of the country, and later Frederic brought them
out in book form under the title "The New Exodus."</p>

<p>President Harrison was much impressed with the report
of the commission, and through diplomatic channels
brought the matter to the attention of the Russian Government.
His reference to this action in the Annual Message
of December, 1891, is such a clear and convincing
recognition of humanitarian diplomacy, that I quote it:</p>

<blockquote><p>This Government has found occasion to express, in a friendly
spirit, but with much earnestness, to the Government of the
Czar, its serious concern because of the harsh measures now
being enforced against the Hebrews in Russia.... It is estimated
that over one million will be forced from Russia within
a few years....</p>

<p>The banishment, whether by direct decree or by not less
certain indirect methods, of so large a number of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
women is not a local question. A decree to leave one country is,
in the nature of things, an order to enter another&mdash;some
other. This consideration, as well as the suggestions of humanity,
furnishes ample ground for the remonstrances which we
have presented to Russia, while our historic friendship for that
Government can not fail to give the assurance that our representations
are those of a sincere wellwisher.</p></blockquote>

<p>The President's Message was largely quoted and favorably
commented upon in this and many European
countries. All of this had a reaction in Russia itself. No
matter how autocratic a government may be, as Russia
then was, it cannot free itself from "a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind." For the time being conditions
in Russia for the Jews were ameliorated.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the fall of 1891 I was a delegate to the Democratic
State Convention at Saratoga and was a member of the
platform committee. One of the questions to be solved
was: What should be our position regarding silver?
Cleveland's statement of his position during his first
term had lost him the Presidency.</p>

<p>Quite purposely Cleveland had boldly accentuated,
while in office, the outstanding issues then before the
country&mdash;the tariff and sound money&mdash;without any
regard to political consequences. His friend, Richard
Watson Gilder, has said of him in this connection:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Every once in a while Cleveland "threw away the Presidency,"
and I never saw him so happy as when he had done it;
as, for instance, after the tariff message, and now again after
the silver letter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cleveland, while not a scholar, was ultra-conscientious
and had an honest and logical mind that dealt with fundamentals.
He would "mull over" (that is the very phrase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I have heard him use) a question until he got to the bottom,
and there he would start to build up his premises and
arrive at his decisions. Because of the surplus accumulating
in the Treasury he had been impressed more and more
with the fact that the taxes and the tariff should be reduced.
He realized, during the spring and summer of
1887, that the rapid increase of this surplus was becoming
a menace to the stability of our financial system, and he
felt it his duty to provide some means for averting commercial
disaster. At the opening of Congress that year,
instead of a message covering all of the Government
activities as was the invariable custom, he prepared one
devoted exclusively to the revenue system and to the
necessity of reducing the tariff. He gave much care and
deliberation to this message, but none to the political
consequences.</p>

<p>Again later, when the free coinage of silver became a
topic of prominence, the Reform Club of New York
invited him to attend a banquet at which this question
was to be discussed. Many of his friends advised that he
remain silent on the subject, in order not to mar his
chances for reëlection. Cleveland, however, accepted the
invitation and boldly announced his position regarding
"the dangerous and reckless experiment of free, unlimited
and independent silver coinage." That was too much for
the machine men of the party; the note of Cleveland's
doom was sounded from one end of the country to the other.</p>

<p>After his retirement partisan bitterness largely disappeared,
and it soon became a foregone conclusion that he
would again have to stand for the Presidency. Although
he had occupied the President's chair only one term, I
doubt whether any ex-President of our time, with the
exception of Roosevelt, carried with him into private life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a deeper interest or a higher esteem on the part of the
great body of the people. His rugged honesty of purpose
and determined stand for the best principles in our public
life were more and more appreciated and valued. During
the entire period between his defeat and his reëlection he
was the most distinguished representative of his party.</p>

<p>When the silver question came up in the State Convention
at Saratoga, a few others and myself contended for
a sound money plank. We met with opposition from a
majority of the platform committee. Richard Croker,
boss of Tammany Hall, had not up to that time bothered
much about the subject. I laid before him the reasons
underlying the question and got him to throw his powerful
influence and help on our side, and we succeeded in
the end in incorporating a strong sound money plank.</p>

<p>Cleveland expressed his satisfaction with that accomplishment
in the following note to me:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
816 <span class="smcap">Madison Avenue</span><br />
<i>Sept.</i> 27, 1891</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:
</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that you had much to do with the formation
of the silver plank in the platform adopted at Saratoga.
I am so well satisfied indeed that you thus merit my thanks as
a citizen who loves the honor of his country and as a Democrat
who loves the integrity of his party, that I desire to tender
them in this frank informal manner.</p>

<div class="signature2">
Yours very truly</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Grover Cleveland</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>I may add here that upon his retirement in 1889 Cleveland
came to New York to live, and the pleasant relations
I had had with him in office became close and intimate.</p>

<p>Early in July, 1892, I wrote Cleveland regarding his
position on the tariff, and after the Chicago convention
which nominated him for the Presidency, I received the
following communication from him:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Gray Gables</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Buzzards Bay, Mass.</span><br />
<i>July</i> 25, 1892</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>:
</p>

<p>I wish to thank you for your letter of July 12, and to express
my disappointment that while in New York last week I did not
have the opportunity to converse with you on the suggestions
which your letter contained. You cannot fail to see by some
expressions in my address in reply to the notification committee,
that thoughts quite similar to yours have occupied my
mind in regard to the tariff plank in our platform. I am exceedingly
anxious that there should be no misrepresentation
of our true position, and I regret exceedingly that there should
have been any form of expression adopted which makes us
liable to that danger.</p>

<p>I shall continue to give the subject earnest thought and when
I write my letter of acceptance if it should then seem to be
necessary I shall not hesitate to pursue the subject further. I
have heard of your labors at Chicago and of your constant and
earnest devotion to my cause, and while your previous conduct
and our relations have been such as to lead me to expect such
things of you, I am none the less gratified and beg to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>With the kind remembrances of Mrs. Cleveland to you and
Mrs. Straus, in which I heartily join, I am</p>

<div class="signature2">
Very truly yours
</div>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Grover Cleveland</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>In 1888 his position on these two questions caused his
defeat; in 1892, his position still the same, these very
issues were the dominant factors that brought about his
renomination and election.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the winter before his second term of office, in
order to get some rest and be freer than was possible in
New York from the constant stream of visitors and place-hunters,
he and his family accepted the invitation of my
brother Nathan to occupy a little frame house which my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
brother had bought from a New Jersey farmer in connection
with the property on which stands the Lakewood
Hotel. The little two-story house, surrounded by pines,
simple as could be, was renovated and painted white,
and became known as "the little White House." To it
from time to time Cleveland summoned the people with
whom he wished to confer&mdash;the leaders of his party with
regard to policies and the make-up of his Cabinet, and
personal friends. He had no secretary and wrote all letters
with his own hand.</p>

<p>During his stay at "the little White House" he sent
for me several times to talk over things with him. On one
of these occasions he proposed connecting me with the
Administration in some way that might be agreeable to
me. While I appreciated highly his intention, I told him I
felt I owed it to my brothers to stick to business for the
next few years. He answered that he would have to have
one of the brothers in his Administration. I learned later
that in his mind he had reserved the ministership to
Holland for Isidor. At about this time Isidor had been
nominated, and was subsequently elected, to fill a vacancy
in Congress, and Cleveland purposely did not fill
the Dutch post until after that special election. He afterwards
remarked to a friend he and Isidor had in common,
William L. Wilson, of West Virginia, chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee and responsible for the
Wilson Tariff Bill, that he much preferred Isidor in
Congress where he could have the benefit of his wisdom
and knowledge in financial and tariff matters. Indeed,
my brother was largely responsible for Cleveland's calling
the extra session of Congress for the repeal of the
Sherman Silver Coinage Act.</p>

<p>Among my letters from Cleveland at this period I have
one concerning a subject that caused a great deal of stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and unfavorable comment: the appointment of James J.
Van Alen, of Newport, Rhode Island, as ambassador to
Italy. Van Alen was a very rich man. He was the son-in-law
of William Astor and the personal friend of William
C. Whitney, the real manager of the Cleveland campaign,
whose appointment as Secretary of the Navy was not
liked by the "mugwump" wing of the party, headed by
Carl Schurz and others. When Van Alen was appointed
a hue and cry arose from the idealists, and Cleveland's
enemies alleged that the appointment was nothing more
than a reward for the very large contribution Van Alen
had made to Whitney for the campaign, for which Whitney
had promised this position. Schurz, as editor of
"Harper's Weekly," wrote a savage editorial against
Cleveland on this subject, and in a letter to me he stated
that he felt Cleveland's prestige would never recover
from the blow he had struck against himself in making
that appointment. I wrote to Cleveland about the matter
and how it was regarded by some of his friends, mentioning
Schurz among others. The President sent me the following
reply:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Executive Mansion</span>, <span class="smcap">Washington</span></div>
<div class="signature2">
<i>Oct.</i> 29, 1893</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:
</p>

<p>Your letter was received to-day.</p>

<p>I need not tell you how much I value your friendship; and I
hardly need confess how touched I am by the manifestation of
affection afforded by the solicitude you evince in the Van
Alen matter. I am amazed by the course pursued by some
good people in dealing with this subject. No one has yet presented
to me a single charge of unfitness or incompetency. They
have chosen to eagerly act upon the frivolous statements of a
much mendacious and mischievous newspaper, as an attempt to
injure a man who in no way has been guilty of wrong. I leave
out of the account the allegation that his nomination was in
acknowledgment of a large campaign contribution. No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
will accuse me of such a trade and Mr. Whitney's and Mr.
Van Alen's denial that any such thing existed in the minds of
any one concerned, I believe to be the truth. I think it would
be a cowardly thing in me to disgrace a man because the New
York World had doomed him to disgrace. Since the nomination
was sent in I have left the matter entirely to the Senate,
and I hear that the nomination was confirmed to-day. This
ends the matter. I am entirely content to wait for a complete
justification of my part in the proceeding.</p>

<p>I am sorry you regard this matter as so unfortunate, and if
anything could have induced me to turn away from a course
which seems to me so plainly just and right, it would be my
desire to satisfy just such good friends as you have always
proved yourself to be.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to see you at all times.</p>

<div class="signature2">Yours very sincerely</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Grover Cleveland</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Van Alen was confirmed by the Senate, but on November
20th he sent in his resignation, which Cleveland reluctantly
accepted, but urged Van Alen to reconsider his
decision, as his (the President's) preference was emphatically
that Van Alen accept the post and by the discharge
of his duties vindicate the wisdom and propriety of his
selection.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the second term I saw little of the President.
I was very much tied to business and went to Washington
only when summoned there to discuss a few international
questions as they arose. But while I am reminiscing
about my relations with Mr. Cleveland, I shall jump
ahead about ten years and speak of a visit he paid me for
three days during March, 1903. He was to deliver an
address at the Henry Ward Beecher Memorial in the
Brooklyn Academy of Music on Sunday evening, and he
arrived from Princeton on Saturday. He was like a boy
out of school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>We were going to the theater on Saturday evening and
I suggested Justin McCarthy's "If I Were King," played
by Sothern.</p>

<p>"I hope it is not sad," Cleveland said. "I want to see
it from start to finish"; and with a smirk he added, "for
I am a hayseed." I discerned afterward that he would
rather have seen a comedy or vaudeville.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the theater, many in the audience
recognized Cleveland and heads were constantly turning
in the direction of our box. I mentioned it to him, but he
said: "Oh, no, they don't know me any more." After the
theater we had a supper of delicatessen and beer at home,
which I knew he would like, and he amused us with several
funny stories and mimicry. My wife remarked that
he might have made a success on the stage, and he replied
that his friend Joe Jefferson had often deplored his having
missed that profession.</p>

<p>Cleveland gave an imitation of the humorous Congressman
Campbell, of New York, who used to come to
the White House and, pointing to the room occupied by
Cleveland, ask the clerk: "Is His Royal Nibs in?" And
sometimes Tim Campbell made requests that Cleveland
had to deny as unconstitutional; then Tim would come
back with "Oh, I wouldn't let the Constitution stand
between friends!"</p>

<p>At dinner on Sunday we were joined by Mr. and Mrs.
John G. Carlisle, my brother Isidor, his wife, and his business
associate, Charles B. Webster. Carlisle had been
one of the most distinguished Senators in Congress,
former Secretary of the Treasury, and a close friend of
Cleveland. When the champagne was served my wife
said to the ex-President:</p>

<p>"Does Mrs. Cleveland let you drink this? You know
it is bad for your rheumatism!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>"No, but I won't tell her," answered Cleveland.</p>

<p>They compromised on one glass.</p>

<p>After dinner the conversation turned to the bond
loans during Cleveland's second Administration&mdash;the
first made through J. P. Morgan &amp; Company and the
subsequent popular loans&mdash;to keep the gold in the
United States Treasury. The ex-President referred to
his fight against the silver craze and said he had been
compelled to abandon the fundamental issue, the tariff
reform, to combat that dangerous heresy.</p>

<p>When the guests had gone, Cleveland wanted to know
whether we would like to hear the speech he was to deliver
that evening, and of course we assured him we
should be delighted. This led to conversation about
Beecher, and I showed him the original letter that
Beecher wrote him in 1887 recommending my appointment
to Turkey. He said he remembered it perfectly, and
it was the thing that turned the scale while he was considering
whether or not he could properly appoint a person
of my race to a post largely concerned with the protection
of Christian missions. I made bold to request the
manuscript of his Memorial Address to file with my
Beecher letter, and he kindly consented with the words:
"Yes, certainly; they are kind of cousins."</p>

<p>After a light supper we drove to Brooklyn. Cleveland
liked to be punctual and I took care that we should arrive
at the appointed hour, 7.45. It was pouring rain, and
Cleveland anticipated that most people would be kept
away; but when we entered the hall it was packed from
pit to dome and several thousand persons were turned
away. At the close of the meeting hundreds crowded onto
the stage to greet the ex-President, showing that the love
and admiration of the people had in no degree waned.</p>

<p>The next morning we prevailed upon him to stay another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
day. He said he knew I had a speech to make at
Brown University and that its preparation would engage
my time. But I assured him the speech was all prepared
and the subject was "Brown in Diplomacy." He asked
me to read it to him, and I did. He pronounced it appropriate
and fine, which gave me some confidence in the
success of the occasion, for I knew he was not given to
flattery and would not have praised the speech without
meaning it; that was not his habit.</p>

<p>He had to go to Rockwood, the photographer, at
Thirty-Ninth Street and Broadway, so I went with him.
He said he had hundreds of requests for pictures and
wanted a new one taken so that when people wrote for
them he could refer such requests to Rockwood; similarly
he had had some pictures made by a Philadelphia photographer.
These arrangements would save him much
trouble. I asked Rockwood to take a special, large picture
for me. He brought forward his larger camera and took
one of the best photographs of Cleveland I have ever
seen. I had two finished: one for Mrs. Cleveland and the
other for myself, and it now hangs in my library.</p>

<p>For luncheon we met Isidor at Delmonico's. At the
next table sat Charles F. Murphy, successor to Croker as
boss of Tammany Hall, who requested me to introduce
him to Cleveland. They had quite a chat, after which
Cleveland remarked: "He looks like a pretty clean fellow."</p>

<p>During the meal our guest told us, with language, voice,
and manner befitting the tale, how, when he was being
spoken of for reëlection before his second term, he met a
farmer who said to him: "Now if you will go on sawin'
wood and don't say nothin', they will give you back that
job in Washington." No actor could have given a more
vivid characterization of that farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>That evening we went to Weber and Field's Music
Hall, on Twenty-Ninth Street near Broadway. Cleveland
suggested this himself. He said he liked to be amused at
the theater and not saddened or instructed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At about this period Cleveland from time to time
showed evidences of illness. He called them stomach attacks.
Whether or not his personal friend and physician,
Dr. Joseph D. Bryant, had diagnosed the malady as more
serious I do not know; but at times I rather inferred that
he had. Dr. Bryant made it a point to accompany Cleveland
on several of his hunting and fishing expeditions,
which were taken not alone for pleasure, but as health
measures, for a change of air and the outdoor recreation.</p>

<p>On and off during those years also, when the family
wanted a little change, they occupied "the little White
House" at Lakewood. Cleveland liked it for its simplicity
and because it was not unlike the parsonage at
Caldwell, New Jersey, where he was born. Early in June,
1908, while the Clevelands were at Lakewood, the ex-President
sent for my brother Isidor; he desired to have
a talk with him. He seemed to wish to unburden his mind.</p>

<p>This proved to be the last time he spoke to any
one outside of his immediate family while still in the
possession of all his faculties. That very night he had
another attack of his malady, after which, as I was told,
his faculties seemed to go under a cloud. Two weeks
later, on June 24th, the country was shocked, though it
was not unprepared, to learn that the ex-President had
died that morning at his Princeton home.</p>

<p>On June 26th Grover Cleveland was laid to rest. The
funeral was private; my brothers and I had received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
note from Mrs. Cleveland asking us to be present. At
his home we met about one hundred of his personal
friends. It had been his express wish that there be no
eulogy or funeral oration, and his friend Dr. Henry van
Dyke conducted a simple service at which he read passages
from Wordsworth's poem, "The Happy Warrior."
In a carriage with Chief Justice Fuller, Judge George
Gray, of Delaware, and Governor Fort, of New Jersey,
I accompanied the body to the cemetery.</p>

<p>For Grover Cleveland there were no longer enemies to
traduce and vilify. Perhaps no President had ever been
so reviled by a hostile press throughout the country as
this great man, and, strong as he was, these attacks quite
naturally pained him. Public appreciation of men who
struggle against the tide for righteous things is often deferred,
sometimes until after death. In his case, happily,
it came while he was yet among us in the constantly increasing
manifestations of admiration, love, and esteem
by the people of the country.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have mentioned that during Cleveland's second
Administration I seldom went to Washington. At that
time I was occupied also with the writing of two books.
I was not, of course, relying upon my pen for a living.
I should not have survived long if I had! Historical
writing has fittingly been called the aristocracy of literature;
it requires long and patient investigation and yields
meager returns. For me it made a fascinating avocation.
My "Roger Williams, the Pioneer of Religious Liberty,"
was published by the Century Company in 1894, and
"The Development of Religious Liberty in the United
States" appeared in a limited edition, published by
Philip Cowen, New York, in 1896.</p>

<p>The latter was a slim volume, an amplification of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
address I had delivered in New Haven before the Yale
College Kent Club, and elsewhere; the former grew out
of studies I had made in preparing my first book, "The
Origin of Republican Form of Government." "Roger
Williams" was well received and had a generous circulation,
being several times reprinted. Brown University,
under the presidency of that eminent historian and
scholar, E. Benjamin Andrews, conferred upon me the
honorary degree of Litt.D.</p>

<p>When I was again in London in 1898 I carried out a
purpose I had long had, to visit Charterhouse School,
earlier known as Sutton's Hospital School, where Roger
Williams received his early education. I met the Reverend
Doctor William Haig Brown, master, who showed
me the register of the school for 1624 containing the inscription
of Roger Williams. When he saw I was much
interested in Roger Williams he told me of a recent life
of him that had been written, which he considered very
fine and with which he wanted to acquaint me. He went
to his library on the floor above, and when he returned
he handed me my own work! (I had not previously told
him my name.)</p>

<p>I observed in the main hall of the school a number of
tablets commemorating distinguished scholars who had
attended there. There were represented Thackeray,
General Shakespeare, Archdeacon Hale, Sir Henry
Havelock, and several who were sacrificed in the Crimean
War and the Indian Mutiny. I asked Dr. Brown whether
he did not think it fitting that a tablet should be added
in memory of Roger Williams, and said that I should be
glad to defray the expense thereof. He agreed, and I
authorized him to have the tablet made. He employed
Howard Ince, a well-known architect, to design the tablet,
which contains the following inscription:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

Founder of the State of Rhode Island, and the<br />
Pioneer of Religious Liberty in America. Placed here by<br />
Oscar S. Straus, United States Minister to Turkey, 1899
</div>

<p>I did not wish my name on it, but Dr. Brown quite
definitely preferred it so.</p>

<p>Of all my books, the "Life of Roger Williams" contains
the greatest amount of work in the way of research and
study; but the amount of pleasure it gave me in the doing
was commensurate.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In politics I had become more impressed year by year
with the importance of a reform in our electoral system,
especially in our large cities. The bosses in the two big
parties were the "invisible powers" who dictated the
nominations. Primaries were primaries in name only,
and were so conducted as to strengthen the power of the
bosses. In Chicago a campaign to purify the primaries
had been carried on by the political committee of the
Civic Federation. The Federation, of which its organizer,
Ralph M. Easley, was the secretary, now enlarged its
scope in the political field and issued a "Call for a National
Conference on Practical Primary Election Reform,"
in the name of some two hundred and fifty of the leading
men of New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and
thirty-five cities in between. Prominent in this list I
remember Mayor William L. Strong, of New York; ex-Mayor
Abram S. Hewitt, of New York; Darwin R. James,
president of the New York Board of Trade; Andrew B.
Humphreys, of the Allied Political Clubs of New York;
Mayor Josiah Quincy, of Boston; Mayor James D.
Phelan, of San Francisco; ex-Mayor George W. Ochs, of
Chattanooga; Albert Shaw; Nicholas Murray Butler;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Carl Schurz; Lyman Abbott; Lyman J. Gage; Melville
E. Stone; Myron T. Herrick; Albert J. Beveridge; Robert
M. La Follette.</p>

<p>The meeting was held in the rooms of the New York
Board of Trade on January 20, 1898, and we organized
the National Primary Election League. I was elected
president; Josiah Quincy, first vice-president; Charles
Emory Smith, of Philadelphia, second vice-president;
Walter C. Flower, of New Orleans, third vice-president;
Ralph M. Easley, secretary; and Darwin R. James,
treasurer. The conference gave a distinct impetus to
primary reform all over the country, and in many of the
States led to the passage of laws providing for such reforms.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the presidential election of 1896 I voted for McKinley,
despite my former political affiliations. The outstanding
issue between the Republican and Democratic
Parties was the money question, and I was an advocate
of sound money.</p>

<p>Early in the new Administration our relations with
Spain were rapidly drifting to a crisis over conditions in
Cuba. My friend General Stewart L. Woodford was
appointed minister to Spain. I gave him a letter of introduction
to Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who was now
British ambassador at Madrid. Wolff was very sympathetic
toward America. Woodford later informed me
that the letter had been very serviceable, especially as
his audience had been delayed for several weeks on account
of the Queen's absence from the capital. He very
frankly laid before Wolff the American position and
attitude with regard to Cuba, which Wolff asked permission
to detail to his Government. Based on that information
the British diplomatic representatives were advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by Lord Salisbury: "The American cause is absolutely
impregnable; govern yourselves accordingly."</p>

<p>President McKinley frequently invited me to Washington
and encouraged my writing to him, especially on
international matters; and my letters always received
prompt reply over his own signature. Accordingly on
March 12, 1898, I wrote him at length stating that perhaps
the impending war with Spain could be averted if
we proposed to Spain a plan of suzerainty. I quote from
my letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have no need for Cuba; our destinies point to the Continent;
to leave it to make conquests will weaken our rights, ...
and will place us against our will on the world's chessboard,
from which we have happily kept clear. The Cuban insurgents
are imbued with a spirit of belligerency, but have neither past
training nor the knowledge to maintain freedom and to accord
to each other individual liberty.</p>

<p>The great problems, I take it, are, first: to stop the war;
secondly, to find a solution which will bring independence to
Cuba, and at the same time preserve the <i>amour propre</i> to
Spain.... The proposition to which I have given considerable
thought ... is the following:</p>

<p>That we insist that Spain accord and Cuba accept the position
of suzerainty such as are the relations between Turkey and
Egypt. This will give Cuba self-government, and will at the
same time preserve the <i>amour propre</i> of Spain by retaining a
semblance of a claim of sovereignty without power to interfere
with self-government on the part of the Cubans.... We could
much better afford to help Cuba with a number of millions
which would after all be a small fraction of what a war would
cost us, ... especially when the end attained is the independence
of Cuba, and attained in such a way as not to entail upon
us unending responsibilities full of care and entangling obligations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Immediately upon receipt of this the President asked
me to come to Washington for a conference. He was very
much interested in the idea and requested me to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
out the plan in more detail. This I did. I discussed with
him the suzerainty plan as developed in Europe and as
it was working in Egypt. I expressed the opinion that as
the leading nations of Europe were familiar with the idea
it was not likely to meet with any serious objections.
McKinley was impressed with the feasibility of my proposal
and was in favor of some such arrangement. He
said he was having difficulty because of the jingo agitation
in Congress and the storming for war of the American
press. He felt when the report of the Board of Inquiry on
the destruction of the Maine was made public, as it would
be in a few days, nothing could hold back Congress and
the press, and the Cuban controversy would be pushed to
an issue.</p>

<p>However, he immediately communicated the plan to
Minister Woodford, who brought it to the attention of
the Spanish Government. General Woodford reported
that he had every reason to believe it would be acceptable
to Spain. But meantime things moved with lightning
speed and war was declared.</p>

<span class="caption">PRESIDENT McKINLEY SENDING THE AUTHOR TO TURKEY ON HIS SECOND MISSION, 1898</span>
</div>

<p>Matters in Turkey at this time were also not going very
smoothly. At a conference with McKinley one day he
showed me a communication from Dr. James B. Angell,
minister at the Porte, suggesting that the only way to
bring Turkey to terms was to send warships up there and
"rattle the Sultan's windows." The President was much
disturbed. He felt the sending of warships might result
in another incident like the blowing up of the Maine. He
said the situation had worried him so that it interfered
with his sleep, and he begged me to accept again the appointment
of minister to Turkey, declaring with conviction
that he regarded me as the only man who could adjust
the situation. I explained to him frankly how I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
situated in regard to my business obligations and that
it was very difficult for me to drop them at this time; but
under the circumstances as he had stated them to me I
felt I had no right to interpose my personal affairs as a
reason for refusing, for I certainly regarded no sacrifice
too great to make in the service of the country when
it was needed, as in this instance. I said I had been
too young to shoulder a gun in the Civil War as he had
done, but with a full understanding of my situation if he
should feel it necessary to call upon me I should be at
his service.</p>

<p>Dr. Angell was a distinguished scholar and not lacking
in diplomatic experience. He was president of the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and had been special
envoy to China. He was also an adviser and one of the
trustees of the American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions. However, in some public utterance
he had criticized Turkey unfavorably, and the Porte was
having its revenge. Every request Dr. Angell made was
declined; exequaturs were refused to our consuls appointed
at Erzerum and Harpoot. Dr. Angell was discouraged
and incensed. He was about to resign.</p>

<p>Finally one day I received a telegram:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Executive Mansion</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, D.C.<br />
<i>May 27</i>, 1898</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Honorable Oscar S. Straus</span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New York
</p>

<p>Remembering our talk of a few months ago I would be glad to
have you accept the post of Minister to Turkey. Dr. Angell
has resigned to take effect 15 of August. I would be pleased to
nominate you before Senate adjourns.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">William McKinley</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>And I telegraphed back that same day:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="smcap">President McKinley</span><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Washington

<p>Your request that I should accept the post of Minister to

deem it my patriotic duty to you and to the country to accept.</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Oscar S. Straus</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Among the telegrams and letters of congratulation I
received was one from William L. Wilson, then the president
of Washington and Lee University at Lexington,
Virginia, reading: "Washington and Lee greets you as
Doctor of Laws."</p>

<p>The National Civic Club of Brooklyn gave me a dinner
and reception, presided over by my friend and college
mate, Frederic W. Hinrichs, at which the leading speaker
was Dr. St. Clair McKelway, editor of the "Brooklyn
Eagle." During the evening a letter was received from
my former chief and Secretary of State, Thomas F.
Bayard, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was my good fortune to be associated with Mr. Straus
when he first took up the tangled web of Turkish diplomacy, so
that few persons can so well attest as I, his possession of those
talents and high personal characteristics which give him
weight everywhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ex-President Cleveland, who was prevented from being
present by another engagement, wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would be glad to join those who will do honor to Mr. Straus
... and thus show my appreciation of his usefulness and the
worth of his good example in recognizing the demands of good
citizenship and responding to the call of public duty.</p></blockquote>

<p>And there were also messages from many others, including
President McKinley.</p>

<p>I did not leave for my post for several months. Meanwhile
I had more conferences with the President regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the Spanish situation. Early in August, in discussing
pending Spanish peace negotiations, he wanted
my ideas regarding them and as to how much of the Philippines
we should take. I strongly advised that we take
as little as possible&mdash;nothing more than a naval and
coaling station; otherwise to appropriate the Philippines
would in the long run entail endless obligations without
commensurate benefits. I told him I believed these to be
the views also of many of the more thoughtful citizens,
and that I had spoken with a number of prominent men,
such as ex-Postmaster-General Wilson, ex-Secretary of
the Treasury Carlisle, and Clifton R. Breckinridge, formerly
of the Ways and Means Committee, all of whom
were of like opinion. The President seemed to appreciate
my view, but again feared the jingo spirit of Congress.
He complained also of the attitude of the Cuban insurgents,
who were exaggerating their numbers as well as
their demands.</p>

<p>Turning for a moment to my appointment, he said:
"I don't know whether you know it, but your nomination
has been received with more praise by all parties throughout
the country than any nomination to office I have
made since I am President." I assured him I was gratified,
but realized the emphasis this put upon my responsibilities.</p>

<p>Because I had been a Cleveland Democrat my appointment
by a Republican President had, of course, created a
great sensation in the press; it was heralded as a step
toward the merit system in our foreign service.</p>

<p>John Bassett Moore was now assistant Secretary of
State, and with him I spent several days in the preparation
of my instructions. I considered him even then the
best equipped authority on international law in the
country, and I thought it was a pity his services could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
not be retained in the Department of State; but his salary
there was five hundred dollars a year less than as professor,
and he had a family to support. He told me that the
President and Secretary Day wished him to accompany
the Peace Commission to Paris, and subsequently he
went as secretary and counsel.</p>

<p>While I was with the President for a final conference
a week before sailing, Attorney-General Griggs came in
all aglow and announced with much enthusiasm that he
had just had a telephone message from Justice White
(Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court,
later Chief Justice) that he would consent to be one of the
members of the Spanish American Peace Commission.
That specially pleased the President because White was
a man of great ability, and because the fact that White
was a Catholic might make a more favorable impression
upon Catholic Spain. The President immediately directed
that the names be given to the press. Shortly
thereafter, however, White reconsidered his acceptance,
for reasons which were not made public, and Senator
George Gray, who was serving as a member of the Quebec
Commission, and who like White was a Democrat, was
prevailed upon by the President to accept in his stead.
The other members were all Republicans. The commission
as finally constituted was: Secretary of State William
R. Day, Senator Cushman K. Davis (chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate), Senator
William P. Frye, Senator George Gray, and Whitelaw Reid.</p>

<p>There was considerable clamor, from missionaries and
others, that we send warships to Turkey. Of this I entirely
disapproved and so told the President. He answered
me: "I shall be guided by you; I shall support you;
I have confidence in your ability and foresight. No vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
will be sent to Turkey unless you demand them, and
then, only then, will they be sent. And when you get to
London I wish you to see Ambassador Hay"&mdash;Hay was
about to return to take up the post of Secretary of State&mdash;"and
tell him that I have not only constituted you
Minister to Turkey, but Secretary of State for Turkey,
and that both he and I will be guided entirely by your
judgment and advice."</p>

<p>In London I had several conferences with Ambassador
John Hay, who was shortly to return to Washington as
Secretary of State in the place of William R. Day, chosen
to head the Spanish-American Peace Commission at
Paris. Mr. Day a few years afterward was made associate
justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the
duties of that post he still discharges with distinction.</p>

<p>Mr. Hay and I went over in detail the questions at
issue in Turkey and the plans I proposed for their adjustment.
I told him of the pressure being brought upon the
President to send warships to the Bosphorus, and said I
regarded such a course as mixing up in the Eastern question,
that traditional tinder box of Europe, aside from
the possible danger of another incident like the blowing-up
of the Maine. Mr. Hay agreed and promised to support
me to the fullest extent in settling matters with
Turkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>I also met Dr. Angell in London on his way back from
Constantinople, and went over matters with him. He
told me what a fruitless year and a half he had had there
and how he was made to feel he was <i>persona non grata</i>.
He had not been invited to dine at the Palace once during
his entire stay.</p>

<p>Before I left London I had a call from William E.
Dodge, of Phelps, Dodge, &amp; Company, New York, and
president of the Evangelical Alliance of America. He
came to express his appreciation for my making the personal
and business sacrifice to go to Turkey again. He
was one of our most benevolent citizens, prominently
connected with the missionary bodies and therefore
deeply interested in the American colleges and schools
in the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>When I left for Constantinople this time, there were
with me, besides my wife, my daughters, Aline and Mildred,
respectively fourteen and fifteen years old; my little
son Roger, six and a half years old, and his nurse; my
niece Sissy, daughter of my brother Nathan; and my
nephew Percy, second son of my brother Isidor, who was
to be my private secretary. Mildred we allowed to return
from Paris to continue her studies at Barnard, as we were
unable to find a suitable school for her in either England
or France. We had sailed for Liverpool on the S.S. Lusitania
on September 3d.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>My friend General Horace Porter had been appointed
ambassador to France, and while in Paris I dined with
him several times. He was a man of means and had located
the embassy in a magnificent residence in one of
the most fashionable parts of Paris. There we met among
others Ferdinand W. Peck, United States Commissioner
to the Paris Exposition, and Mrs. Peck; also William F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Draper, ambassador to Italy, who with Mrs. Draper was
in Paris on a leave of absence.</p>

<p>To Messrs. Porter and Draper I proposed what I had
felt the need for during my earlier mission: some sort of
coördination and coöperation among our various diplomatic
representatives throughout Europe. I suggested
we might have conferences from time to time, or prevail
upon the State Department to keep each of us informed
respecting negotiations between the Department and all
the others. Much of this material would be of interest
and value to us in connection with our respective embassies
or missions. It was being done by other foreign
offices. The British Foreign Office, for instance, issues
confidential communications in the form of blueprints,
which are sent to the heads of all British missions.
During my previous sojourn at Constantinople my colleague,
Sir William White, frequently gave me the benefit
of extracts from these blueprints referring to American
matters. They were very informing and helpful.</p>

<p>Porter and Draper said they would coöperate with me
in urging the State Department to adopt some such
scheme, and when I wrote to our colleague at Berlin,
Andrew D. White, he gave similar support. However,
when I suggested the idea to the State Department
nothing came of it. Since then some further effort has
been made in that direction, but I have not learned to
what extent this desired system has been effected.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We went on to Vienna to meet Baroness de Hirsch,
who was coming from her estate at Eichhorn. She had
put her beautiful Paris residence on the rue d'Elysée at
our disposal, but unfortunately my appointments made
it impossible for us to avail ourselves of her hospitality.
The Baroness looked ill to me, and I warned her against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
allowing her intense occupation with benevolent activities
to wear upon her. She said she had had the grippe,
and later told my wife that her physicians feared her
ailment might be more serious. In spite of this, however,
she went right on, while at the Hotel Bristol in Vienna,
with conferences with her almoners, among others Ritter
von Gutmann and Baron Günzburg, who were associated
with her in her endowed enterprises in Austria and elsewhere.
Alas, her malady was more serious than grippe,
for it was only a short time after our reaching Constantinople
that her family informed us of her death.</p>

<p>We met some of the leading Jewish scholars, artists,
and literary men while in Vienna: the architect, Wilhelm
Stiassny; the actor, Adolf von Sonnenthal; Dr. Adam
Politzer; the Hungarian artists, Leopold Horowitz and
Isidor Kaufmann; Professor David Heinrich Miller, of
the Vienna University; and the attorney, Dr. Adolph
Stein. Herr Stiassny was president of the Jewish Historical
Society, and at a meeting of that body at which I
was present he referred in glowing terms to my appointment,
saying that, amid the anti-Semitic spirit that was
taking hold of Austria and other European countries,
America had shown by my appointment that no race or
religious distinction existed here, which could not fail to
have an influence in Austria and in several other European
states.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On arriving at Constantinople we were welcomed by
the secretary of the legation and acting chargé, John W.
Riddle, together with other members of the legation and
consulate and several of the missionaries. Mr. Riddle,
by the way, had conducted the affairs of the legation in
the interim with discretion and ability. He has since
filled several other posts most creditably; he was ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to Russia under Roosevelt, and at the present
writing is ambassador to Argentina.</p>

<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs at the Porte now was
Tewfik Pasha, who had been ambassador to Germany.
He spoke German better than French, so I conversed
with him in the former language. As was customary,
I left with him the letters of recall of my predecessor
and a copy of my presentation address. I was informed
that the Sultan and all the officials at the Porte were
pleased at my return, because they knew me and had
every confidence in me both personally and officially. Of
course, these remarks may have been diplomatic politeness,
but events seemed to show some sincerity in them.
My audience, for instance, instead of being delayed for
weeks, was granted within one week of my arrival; and instead
of being accorded the lesser formalities of a minister,
I was received with all the ceremony accorded an ambassador:
four state carriages were placed at my disposal,
preceded by four postilions and outriders; a detachment
of guards rendered military honors as I arrived at the
Palace; the Sultan was attended by Osman Pasha, Fouad
Pasha, general-in-chief of the Turkish armies, and some
thirty other high civil and military officers.</p>

<p>After the formality of presenting my credentials and
making my address, the Sultan reiterated three times
that he felt great pleasure in welcoming me back, as my
former mission had given him much satisfaction. He said
that he knew I was a "gentleman"; and that is the only
English word I had ever heard him use.</p>

<p>President McKinley had authorized me to arrange for
the elevation of the mission at Constantinople to an embassy,
as by the Act of March 3, 1893, provision was
made for the appointment of ambassadors. Up to that
time, based on the idea that ambassadors represented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
person of a monarch and that republics should not thus
be represented, we had had only ministers. The act reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whenever the President shall be advised that any foreign
government is represented, or is about to be represented, in the
United States by an ambassador, envoy extraordinary, minister
plenipotentiary, minister resident, special envoy, or chargé
d'affaires, he is authorized, in his discretion, to direct that the
representative of the United States to such government shall
bear the same designation.</p></blockquote>

<p>The initiative for sending an ambassador, therefore, rested
with the foreign power, and we could not send an ambassador
to Turkey until that Government accredited an
ambassador to us.</p>

<p>During my audience I informed the Sultan that the
President had said he would be pleased to raise our mission
to an embassy, but I observed that His Majesty
did not take kindly to the suggestion. He replied politely
that he would take it under consideration.</p>

<p>Among my colleagues, Baron Calice still represented
Austria-Hungary. Germany was represented by Baron
Marschall von Bieberstein, former Prussian minister, a
large man of the von Moltke physique; he died later
in London (1912) after a short service as ambassador to
Britain. From France there was Paul Cambon, brother
of Jules Cambon, who was ambassador at Washington at
the time of the Spanish-American War and continued the
Spanish negotiations after our rupture with Spain; a
little while after my arrival in Constantinople Paul
Cambon was transferred to London. From Great Britain
there was Nicholas R. O'Conor, whom I met during my
former mission when he was consul-general and chargé
at Sophia; he had meanwhile been ambassador to Russia.
And from Italy there was Signor Pansa. Severally they
informed me that since my first mission, ten years before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the power of the Ottoman Government had been more
and more concentrated in the Palace, that the Sultan
himself was the "whole show" and very little power was
left at the Porte.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Constantinople was all agog with preparation and
excitement, for the Emperor and Empress of Germany
were expected on October 17th! (As a matter of fact,
rough weather on the Ægean caused them to arrive a day
late.) The main streets of Pera were paved anew, and
the walls surrounding Yildis were newly whitewashed.
All business at the Porte was suspended. A Government
official told me that the visit would probably cost the
Ottoman Empire not less than five hundred thousand
pounds! One of the residences at Yildis, near the Palace,
was placed at the Emperor's disposal.</p>

<p>As is customary on such visits, all the heads of missions
left their cards at the German embassy and inscribed
their names in the Emperor's visiting register. Each visit
was promptly returned the next day by von Bülow,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who left his card.</p>

<p>The Emperor and Empress drove through Pera in
state, preceded by a company of Turkish lancers and followed
by numerous officers on horses and in carriages.
They rode in the royal victoria, drawn by four horses, accompanied
by numerous outriders in gala uniforms and
on caparisoned horses. The whole procession was gorgeous,
and the royal pair bowed to left and right as the
crowds in the streets greeted them.</p>

<p>Some time after midnight on October 20-21 the doorbell
rang and my portier brought me a communication,
just received from the Grand Master of Ceremonies at the
Palace, inviting Mrs. Straus, myself, and our first dragoman
to the banquet to the German Emperor and Empress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at 7.15 o'clock on the evening of the 21st. The doyen of
the diplomatic corps had sent suggestions that the ladies
wear high neck and long sleeves, as the Sultan objected to
the regulation European evening dress. The ladies accordingly
contrived to cover their necks and arms with
chiffons, laces, and long gloves. It proved unnecessary,
however, because the Empress and her ladies-in-waiting
wore the usual décolleté.</p>

<p>In the recollection of the oldest diplomats present,
this banquet was the most brilliant in its appointments
that had ever been given at the Palace. More than one
hundred persons were there, all the heads of missions and
the leading officials of the empire. The approach to the
Palace for quite a distance was illuminated and lined on
both sides of the way with rows of soldiers. At the Palace
entrance, where we were met by the court officials, we
passed between rows of magnificently uniformed Turkish
and German officers, each wearing his full regalia of
numerous decorations.</p>

<p>At the proper time we were ushered into the audience
room, where the diplomats and their wives were arranged
in a circle, the ladies on one side and the gentlemen on the
other. When the Emperor and Empress with the Sultan
entered, every one made a court bow. The Sultan and
the Emperor then engaged in conversation through an
interpreter in the center of the circle, while the Empress
greeted each lady individually. Each person, as was the
custom, bowed before and after being spoken to. When
the Empress had greeted all the ladies and started with
the gentlemen, the Emperor started with the ladies.</p>

<p>When he came to Mrs. Straus, he made some mention
of having seen her queen lately and that she was as beautiful
as ever. Mrs. Straus, by way of indicating that she
was from the United States, said, "I suppose Your Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
refers to Mrs. McKinley"; but the Emperor, evidently
without stopping to listen to what was being said,
clicked his heels, made his courtesy, and greeted the next
person. It seems on being introduced he had misunderstood
"Roumanie" for "Etats-Unis," especially since
Mrs. Straus was next to the Serbian minister's wife.
Count Eulenburg later explained to Mrs. Straus that the
Emperor's hearing was a little defective.</p>

<p>When the Emperor reached me, he at once expressed a
keen desire that it might be possible for him to visit my
country, and especially our great shipyards, such as those
of Cramp, which he had heard were wonderful. He then
asked me whether I knew our ambassador at Berlin,
Andrew D. White; and when I informed him that Mr.
White had been a friend of mine for a number of years,
he said a few complimentary words about him.</p>

<p>The dinner service included gold plates and gold knives
and forks. The waiters wore brilliant red and gold uniforms.
Between courses the Sultan and the Emperor
conversed by means of the interpreter who stood behind
them, and until they had finished talking the waiters were
patiently holding the next course up in the air for a
cooling.</p>

<p>After the dinner we again formed a circle, made more
courtesies at the proper time, while the Sultan himself
went round and greeted and shook hands with each one.
That ended the royal dinner.</p>

<p>During the meal I sat next to the Emperor's personal
physician, Dr. Lidhold. He had held the same position
under the late Frederick III, whom he characterized as
a most lovable man. He said William II was active and
fond of amusing himself, and enjoyed constantly traveling
about, which was not so pleasant for his physician
and other members of his train. He admitted that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Emperor's left arm was quite lame, but it did not interfere
much with his movements because he had acquired
such dexterity with the other. He added that the magnificent
attentions of the Sultan could not fail to have
a great influence upon Germany's attitude toward the
Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>The visit of the Emperor at this time, following as it
did the dreadful massacre of Armenians only a few years
before at Harpoot and then at Constantinople itself,
was very much resented by the Christians throughout
Europe. It was interpreted as an effort on the part of the
Emperor, for his own gain, to reinstate the "bloody
Sultan" in the esteem of the world. It was stated that
the Sultan presented the Empress with a very costly
string of pearls.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One of the four outstanding questions included in my
instructions concerned the right of our citizens to travel
in the interior of Turkey. Following the Armenian massacres
of 1896 the Turkish Government made new passport
regulations, and all foreigners were required to get a
tezkirah, or special local passport, from the Sultan before
traveling into the interior. As usual in Turkey, asking
for a permit of any kind was one thing; getting it was
quite another. This regulation proved most obstructive
to our missionaries and those of Great Britain who had
missions in the interior. They would go home or to
Europe on a leave of absence, and upon returning to
Constantinople would be held up, sometimes for weeks,
on account of these tezkirahs, which were not definitely
refused, but not given, which practically amounted to
the same thing.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Constantinople eight Americans,
bound for Erzerum and Harpoot, were being held up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this way. One of them was Dr. C. F. Gates, president of
the Euphrates College at Harpoot. After exhaustive
negotiations with the authorities, in which I pointed out
the fact that refusal of the tezkirah was in violation of
treaty rights, I myself gave Dr. Gates a permit, signed by
me, with the seal of the legation on it. I then informed
the Porte of my action and said that if any injury befell
the party <i>en route</i> I should hold the Turkish Government
responsible. I also sent an open cable to our State Department
informing Secretary Hay what I had done.
My British colleague was a bit disturbed when he heard
of it, because there were several British missionaries in the
party.</p>

<p>That same night I got another of those Turkish midnight
messages. After apologizing for disturbing me, the
messenger brought me the intelligence that my cable had
been held back, and that the Minister of Foreign Affairs
sent word that instructions had been given for the full
protection of the missionaries <i>en route</i> to their posts.
That broke down the passport regulations, and a very
few days thereafter I received notice that the Council
of Ministers had taken up the matter and ruled that the
regulations for traveling into the interior should be restored
to what they were before the Armenian troubles.</p>

<p>At about the same time I was enabled to cable to our
Department of State that I had obtained the Sultan's
iradé granting the exequatur for our consul at Erzerum.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The third item in my instructions, the Treaty of
Naturalization, I had to drop. The Porte refused to
negotiate this question because of the failure of our
Government to accept the terms I had obtained during
my previous mission, and for this I could not blame them.
As during my earlier mission, when matters involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
questions of naturalization arose I succeeded in securing
the rights of the persons concerned on the merits of each
individual case.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Lastly there was the question of indemnities due missionaries
at Harpoot and Marash for property, real and
personal, plundered and destroyed during the massacres.
This was a delicate matter, because the Americans were
not alone in making claims for such damage; also the
Government was very poor. At first the Porte denied all
liability and refused to pay. I started the negotiations in
November, 1898, and the process proved a long and
tedious one, lasting over a year. But step by step progress
was made. By December the Sultan admitted the claims
and promised to pay as soon as the amount was fixed. By
February, with the amount still unfixed, he had decided
how payment was to be made: he would buy a cruiser in
America, to the cost of which the indemnities could be
added, enabling him to make payment "behind a screen,"
which he preferred. He said arrangements were being
made for loans through a bank in Paris to begin installments
on such a contract. By early September the iradé
for the purchase of a ship from some American builder
had been given, and plans were being studied to determine
the type of ship. By the end of the month the Sultan
again assured me that the subject was receiving his attention
and would be settled in a month or two.</p>

<p>The state of the Turkish finances was, of course, deplorable,
and the Minister of Foreign Affairs told me
that the Government was planning to apply to the purchase
of the ship, money coming due in two months upon
the conversion of some loans. And there were claims from
England, France, Germany, and Italy, none of which the
Sultan had recognized or promised to pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Even so, I planned that if His Majesty showed a
disposition to deny his promise I should offer to arbitrate
and thus bring matters to a head. That would put him
upon one of two horns of a dilemma: if he accepted, it
definitely and authoritatively exposed to all the world
the horrible details of the massacre; if he refused, it put
him in the position of having declined the only peaceful
method of adjustment. Tewfik Pasha, however, in the
name of the Sultan continued to make promises of payment,
and the matter dragged along a few months more.</p>

<p>Having settled all other problems that were irritating
the relations of the two Governments, I asked for leave
to visit the United States. I planned this trip so as to
accentuate our displeasure at the procrastination of the
Ottoman Government in settling the indemnities, and
notified the Minister of Foreign Affairs that as my Government
had been patient for over a year I should now return
home for consultation regarding the delay.</p>

<p>Upon my return to the United States I carried on the
negotiations through the Turkish minister at Washington
and prepared the instructions for our chargé at Constantinople
through the State Department. This finally
resulted in a contract with the Cramp Shipbuilding Corporation,
with an additional amount of ninety-five thousand
dollars to pay the indemnity claims, though actual
payment was not made until June, 1901, under the incumbency
of John G. Leishman, my successor.</p>

<p>During the course of the indemnity negotiations I
succeeded in obtaining the Sultan's iradé for the rebuilding
of college and missionary buildings at Harpoot which
had been injured or destroyed during the massacres.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Among the interesting episodes during these fifteen
months at Constantinople was what might be termed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
diplomatic romance. In the spring of 1899 I received a
letter from Secretary Hay enclosing a communication
from William E. Curtis, Washington correspondent of the
"Chicago Record," and one of the best-known syndicate
writers of the time, who was well informed regarding what
was going on in both official and unofficial circles at Washington.
Curtis reported a conversation with an important
official of the Turkish legation wherein he learned that
since the Turko-Greek War the Sultan had regained authority
and respect among Mussulmans throughout the
world, and his advisers thought the time propitious for
him, as the religious head of Islam, to make known his
authority to the Mohammedans of the Philippines, Java,
and neighboring islands. The official had gone on to say
that our victories over Spain had surprised the Sultan
beyond description, and he was anxious to cultivate the
friendship of a government whose navy could sink the
enemy's fleet and go round the world without the loss of
a man.</p>

<p>Curtis thought that, in view of our present minister's
influence and our good relations with the Turkish Government,
the Sultan under the circumstances might be prevailed
upon to instruct the Mohammedans of the Philippines,
who had always resisted Spain, to come willingly
under our control. Secretary Hay said he would give me
no advice or instructions, but would leave to my judgment
what, if any, action I might deem it wise to take;
that if I could succeed in getting the Sultan of Turkey to
send a message to the Sultan of the Sulu Islands which
would result in peaceful and harmonious relations between
the Sulu Sultan and our officers, it would of course be a
great accomplishment. The subject interested me greatly.
I saw the possibility of rendering an effective service,
and I was fascinated by the romance of the suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>When I went to Turkey on my first mission, my father
placed his hands upon my head, gave me his blessing,
and a parting advice which sank deep into my consciousness:
"When you have an important matter coming
before you, don't act promptly, but sleep over it." My
father's death in January, 1898, accentuated this advice
in my memory, and when I received the Hay-Curtis
letters I followed it. I knew very little about the Philippines.
I doubt that our State Department knew much
more. The library at Constantinople had nothing on the
subject. I had a copy of the testimony taken by our
commissioners at the Paris peace negotiations, but it
contained only vaguest references. But one of my colleagues
had the works of Jean Jacques Reclus, the French
geographer. From this I learned that the Mohammedans
of the Philippines were not Shiites, like those of
Persia, but Sunnites, and therefore recognized the Sultan
of Turkey as their spiritual head.</p>

<p>I thought about the problem for a few days, and then
I sent a note to the Palace that I should like to have an
audience with His Majesty, as I had some private communication
to make to him that I believed might interest
him, for it would enable him to render a great service to a
section of his co-religionists. The audience was promptly
arranged, and I gathered that the Sultan knew very little
about the Sulu Mohammedans. He asked regarding their
sect. I told him they were Sunnites. He asked whether
they made pilgrimages to Mecca. I told him I thought
they did, the same as those of Borneo.</p>

<p>Then a curious incident occurred. In order to be able
to take up the matter very fully with the Sultan, I had
anticipated all kinds of questions and armed myself with
pertinent information. Among them I thought he might
seek some assurance as to our Government's attitude toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Mohammedanism, and to reassure him I had come
prepared with a translation into Turkish of Article XI of
an early treaty between the United States and Tripoli,
negotiated by Joel Barlow in 1796. It read:</p>

<blockquote><p>As the Government of the United States of America is not in
any sense founded on the Christian Religion; as it has in itself
no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility
of Musselman; and as the said States never have entered into
any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is
declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious
opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony
existing between the two countries.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the Sultan had read this, his face lighted up. It
would give him pleasure, he said, to act in accordance
with my suggestions, for two reasons: for the sake of
humanity, and to be helpful to the United States. He
added that he hoped his services would be appreciated,
and that when occasion presented itself a like friendly
spirit would be shown to him. He knew I was a "gentleman"
and would make known to my Government the
spirit in which he met my suggestions. The Mohammedans
in question recognized him as khalif of the Moslems
and he felt sure they would follow his advice.</p>

<p>We discussed means of conveying his message to them,
and finally decided to send a telegram to Mecca, where
the Moslem pilgrims were then gathered, to ascertain if
any Sulu chiefs were there. Before transmitting it, His
Majesty's secretary read the telegram to me in translation.</p>

<p>Two days later the Sultan invited me to the Palace to
inform me that he had received a reply that two Sulu
chiefs were at Mecca. Another telegram was then formulated
instructing the chiefs in the name of the Sultan
that a definite understanding had been reached with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the American Elchi Bey (American minister) that they
would not be disturbed in the practice of their religion if
they would promptly place themselves under the control
of the American army; that because of the Sultan's deep
concern for their welfare he advised and instructed them
to return at once to their people to prevent any bloodshed.</p>

<p>Immediately I cabled Secretary Hay, that he might
be able to advise General Bates, one of our commanders
in the Philippines. The negotiation proved to be very
important and valuable to us. Some three months later
our Government received word from the Philippines that
an insurrectionist leader, Aguinaldo, had sent emissaries
among these Sulu Mohammedans, but they had refused
to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves
under the control of our army, thereby recognizing
American sovereignty.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel John P. Finley, who had been
governor of the District of Zamboanga, Moro Province,
of the Philippine Islands for ten years, wrote an article
for the April, 1915, issue of "The Journal of Race Development"
in which he refers to this incident:</p>

<blockquote><p>At the beginning of the war with Spain the United States
Government was not aware of the existence of any Mohammedans
in the Philippines. When this fact was discovered and
communicated to our ambassador in Turkey, Oscar S. Straus,
of New York, he at once saw the possibilities which lay before
us of a holy war.... He sought and gained an audience with
the Sultan, Abdul Hamid, and requested him as Caliph of the
Moslem religion to act in behalf of the followers of Islam in the
Philippines.... A telegram to Mecca elicited the fact that
they not only visited Mecca in considerable numbers, but that
at that very time there were Moros from Sulu in the Sacred
City.... The Sultan as Caliph caused a message to be sent to
the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch
as no interference with their religion would be allowed under
American rule.</p>

<p>President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks to Mr.
Straus for the excellent work he had done, and said its accomplishment
had saved the United States at least twenty
thousand troops in the field. If the reader will pause to consider
what this means in men and also the millions in money, he
will appreciate this wonderful piece of diplomacy in averting a
holy war.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was one commercial trouble to be attended to,
in the settlement of which I nevertheless emphasized the
human aspect. Bread was, of course, one of the main
staples of the people, and it was rising in price. There
was a shortage of flour, yet a shipment of twenty thousand
bags from the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Company
of Minneapolis had been rejected. The reason given was
that it did not contain a sufficient percentage of gluten
and elasticity.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a shipment received six months
before had had the effect of reducing the retail price of
bread about thirty-three per cent. Such shipments competed
with the local flour mills, whose owners, chiefly
Greeks, thereafter paid liberal baksheesh (tips, or bribe
money) to have the flour rejected.</p>

<p>I secured expert testimony to show that the flour, instead
of being inferior, was far superior to the local flour.
I made the issue urgent and sent an open telegram to
our State Department that the flour was being refused
admission in distinct violation of our treaty rights. This
had the effect I anticipated. The flour was admitted.</p>

<p>The result of this negotiation was reflected in every
household, and was significant especially for the poorer
people, who were grateful to the American legation and
the American people for further reducing the price of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
their bread. After this, other large shipments of flour
arrived from time to time and were admitted without
difficulty.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The British ambassador came to me one day to ask
whether, in view of the success I had had in opening and
protecting American schools, I could give him some assistance
in the protection of the orphanages which British
benevolent societies had established following the Armenian
massacres. The Duke of Westminster had called
the attention of Her Majesty's Government to the Porte's
ruthless closing of a number of these orphanages.</p>

<p>Although it was not a matter that came officially under
my jurisdiction, I told my colleague I should be glad to
aid in every way possible. I called on the Grand Vizier
and explained to him that if the Government persisted in
destroying these institutions for the protection of orphan
children, it would have a prejudicial effect in aggravating
the justified horror produced in America as well as in
England by those massacres. I stated frankly that while
this was not an American question, it would, none the
less, from a humanitarian standpoint, create a disastrous
impression to the further disadvantage of the Turkish
Government.</p>

<p>We got the desired result. It so pleased my colleague
that in reporting to Lord Salisbury he expressed great
appreciation for the valuable help I had given him. This
recognition was widely published, in the London "Times"
and other British papers, as well as throughout America.
The Germans also reaped some benefit, for several of the
orphanages, as at Palu and Diarbekir, were under the
supervision of their nationals.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Occasionally in the City of the Sultan there arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
strange and peculiar incidents. I had a call one day from
Monsignor Bonetti, the papal delegate, who had a summer
residence near mine. He said it had been reported to him
that a Roman priest named Brann, who had left his position
in America about a year before because of some moral
delinquencies, had arrived in Turkey within a few days.
He was doubtless under an assumed name, but Bonetti
had heard that the renegade priest was among our missionaries,
and requested that I make inquiry. I asked
him what he proposed doing should the priest be found.
He said he wanted to counsel him to return to the church.
The missionaries with whom I spoke gave me every assistance,
but the priest had evidently not come among them,
for he could not be found.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A number of distinguished people, European and American,
visited Constantinople during the winter of 1898-99.
Lord Rosebery arrived in his mother's yacht and was the
guest of the British ambassador, Sir Nicholas O'Conor.
We had the pleasure of meeting him several times at
dinner. In a conversation I had with him he expressed
great admiration for America and said that at one time
he was on the point of becoming an American. I remember
particularly his remark to the effect that he believed
America and England, by coöperating, would control the
world for the interests of the world, without having to
fight a battle; that the peace and welfare of the world
were in their hands, and sooner or later it must come.</p>

<p>We talked about our respective forms of government,
parliamentary and congressional. He thought McKinley
wise in referring all questions, during and since the
Spanish-American War, to Congress. To quote his own
words: "He is sailing on unknown seas, and it is wise to
let the representative body do the steering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>He asked whether I was an ambassador or a minister.
I explained to him that the President desired to raise the
mission to an embassy, but as the law stood we were dependent
upon the initiative of the Sultan. He said that
during his incumbency as prime minister he had much to
do with having the United States name an ambassador to
London; he took special care that Great Britain should
be the first nation to send an ambassador to Washington
and to receive an American ambassador.</p>

<p>He spoke in a complimentary manner of Secretary Hay
and said he should have remained in London, especially
as it seemed to be his preference. He spoke of the ambassadorship
of Edward J. Phelps and said he had heard
him make some of the ablest public speeches he ever listened
to; they were effective not only in what they expressed,
but in their reserve. He thought public speaking
in America was more finished than in England, of a
higher order or better grounded from the standpoint of
oratory: "We can't speak as you do."</p>

<p>I replied that one had only to point to him as an example
to disprove that complimentary comparison. But
he thought hardly anybody ever read his speeches.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, and his wife,
together with the great-grandson of Alexander Hamilton,
Philip Schuyler, and his wife, came to Constantinople.
We saw much of them. The Mitchells had just lost their
daughter.</p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell, who was regarded as the leading authority
on nervous diseases&mdash;if I mistake not it was he who
first introduced the rest cure, at any rate so far as America
is concerned&mdash;was very anxious to see something of
a Turkish household, which was not easily possible by
reason of the seclusion of Turkish women. It happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that Tewfik Pasha, Minister of Foreign Affairs, had
often spoken to me about the illness of his wife, who
seemed to be suffering from some nervous ailment. She
was a German-Swiss whom he had married while ambassador
at Berlin, but their <i>ménage</i> was kept purely
Turkish. Here, then, was my opportunity to kill two
birds with one stone: I should satisfy Dr. Mitchell's
curiosity by rendering Tewfik Pasha a service. In speaking
to the Pasha I explained, of course, that Dr. Mitchell
would accept no fee, that he would give his services as
a favor to me and an act of courtesy to him. Dr. Mitchell
was able to prescribe with excellent effect for Mme.
Tewfik, and the Pasha was very grateful indeed.</p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell and I went to the museum one afternoon
to see two famous marble tombs that had recently been
unearthed at Sidon, upon discovery by Hamdy Bey,
director of the museum. Both these tombs were supposed
to be of the best period of ancient Greece. One was known
as the Alexander tomb because it portrayed in high bas-relief
the battle of Issus and also a hunting scene, in each
of which one of the figures was identified as portraying
Alexander. At first some scholars believed it to be the
tomb of the monarch himself, but that seemed not to be
correct, and it was doubtless the tomb of one of his generals.
The other tomb was of equal size and proportions,
about five feet high and ten feet long. Round its four
sides it had a number of figures of a woman in various
phases of mourning, the same figure with varying expressions.
This ancient work of art appealed to the bereaved
heart of Dr. Mitchell and he sat before it for quite
a while. Later he wrote an "Ode to a Lycian Tomb,"
one of the best, if not the best, of his poems. He sent me
a copy when it was privately printed, and subsequently
it appeared in the "Century Magazine."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>The inauguration of trips to the Orient by the Hamburg-American
and the North German Lloyd Steamship
Companies frequently brought hundreds of Americans
to Constantinople at a time. In March the S.S. Augusta-Victoria
arrived with three hundred and fifty American
visitors. The Sultan was most gracious to them. Through
one of his aides he asked me to invite them to Selamlik,
after which he arranged a luncheon for them on the
grounds of the ambassadorial kiosque, and had them visit
the royal stables. When they left, the Sultan's aide carried
on board the ship for them a large assortment of delicious
Turkish candies and cigarettes, which they appropriately
acknowledged in a letter that I transmitted to the Palace
for them.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From time to time, especially when the weather was
fine, I attended Selamlik, as was customary among the
diplomats. On one very beautiful Friday I took with me
my little son Roger, then seven years old. It was the
Sultan's birthday and the pageant was exceptionally
fine. From the window of the ambassadorial kiosque
Roger leaned out as far as he possibly could to get a good
view of the Sultan as he passed beneath in his victoria.
The Sultan bowed in acknowledgment of our greeting,
when suddenly Roger realized that he had not taken off
his cap and pulled it off rather comically. This made the
Sultan smile, and it was the only time I ever saw his
habitually sad face wreathed in a smile.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After a strenuous winter, replete with difficult and
trying negotiations, I took advantage of the invitation
of M. Paul Stefanovich-Schilizzi, a philanthropist of
Greece, to visit him in Athens in May. He was a man of
great wealth and beloved throughout the Near East by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
reason of his benevolence. It is his niece, who was a frequent
guest at our home, who recently married Eleutherios
Venizelos, the famous Greek statesman.</p>

<p><i>En route</i> to Athens we stopped for several days at
Smyrna, where we met Kiamil Pasha, the Grand Vizier
with whom I had so satisfactorily carried on a number of
important negotiations during my first mission. He was
now vali at Smyrna, highly regarded, and justly called
the "grand old man" of Turkey, being about seventy-five
years old. Amid the corruption of his time no one
ever questioned his honesty. He had been grand vizier
several times. He spoke English fluently, doubtless acquired
in his youth at Cyprus, where he was born.</p>

<p>He deplored the hopeless condition of affairs at Constantinople,
where all the power had gradually been
concentrated at the Palace. Thus the grand vizierate
became a post without power, which, he explained, did
not interest him any longer. Besides, he did not agree
with the Sultan's methods, though he was thoroughly
loyal to Turkey. His sympathies, as between the contending
powers, were with Great Britain; he believed
good relationship with her was the surest guarantee for
the welfare of his country.</p>

<p>From Smyrna we took a ship for Piræus, a sixteen-hour
trip. There we took a carriage, instead of the train, to
Athens. We stayed at the Hotel Grande Bretagne, which
was owned by our friend Stefanovich. It was, and
doubtless still is, the leading hotel on the square near the
King's palace, and from the balcony of our rooms we
had a clear view of the Acropolis.</p>

<p>This was our second visit to Athens. We had been
there ten years before as guests at the beautiful residence
of Dmitri Stefanovich-Schilizzi, brother of Paul, where
we were sumptuously entertained; we dined at the palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
attended several functions there, and met, at various
social gatherings, the leading people of the city. This
time, however, we came for rest and recreation; we made
no official calls, but spent the six days or so visiting
places of interest, chiefly the excavations that were being
made, and the museum.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Returning we took a steamer direct for Constantinople.
We had learned that the Montenegrin portier in charge of
our house at Pera had a slight case of smallpox, so we
went directly to our summer home at Yenikeui on the
Bosphorus, about a mile distant from Therapia where
most of my colleagues had their summer residences. We
had succeeded in securing a house that was a veritable
palace and admirably arranged for entertaining, so that
we were well able to reciprocate the attentions of our
colleagues and extend proper hospitalities. A wealthy
Greek had constructed and owned this mansion, but on
account of some questionable dealings with the Palace
involving large sums of money, he was a fugitive from
Turkey.</p>

<p>The house was surrounded by a park of its own, fronting
on the Bosphorus. There were pomegranate and
magnolia trees in bloom, under which we took our lunch.
We had a launch that I named the Franklin, and it was
one of the fastest on the Bosphorus, so that within an
hour I could readily be at the Porte to transact the business
of the legation, although things are more quiet during
the summer.</p>

<p>Altogether that summer was thoroughly delightful.
My brother Isidor and his devoted wife had both joined
us. My brother had had an attack of influenza and his
health was not very good, so they had come to Europe
to consult a distinguished specialist, Professor Erb, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Heidelberg. After completing the cure my brother came
to Constantinople for rest and quiet with us. The climate
on the Bosphorus is ideal, never very hot because of the
constant cool breezes from the Black Sea. During that
summer there were only three days when the thermometer
rose to ninety.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to prosper with me. I had brought
several important issues to a successful termination;
our whole immediate family was together, for Mildred had
come to spend her vacation with us; and I had the pleasure
of a visit from my dear brother and his wife. I recall
no period of my life that was such a happy one.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Toward the end of the year I telegraphed to Washington
for leave to return home. I had adjusted all the matters
at issue between the two Governments except the
indemnity, so that I felt justified in leaving my post. I
knew that I could rely on Lloyd C. Griscom, the secretary
who would be in charge, for a tactful and efficient
handling of the affairs of the legation. The indemnity
required only steady pressure and patience. As I have
already stated I timed my return so as to make it effective
in adding a little more pressure.</p>

<p>When I was about to depart, the Sultan sent to my
residence a pair of beautiful vases, each several feet high,
and artistically ornamented. They were manufactured
at the royal pottery which the Sultan had had established
on the Palace grounds, and the workmanship was French.
As the question of cost did not enter into the manufacture,
some wonderful productions were turned out at this
pottery, and the vases sent to me were exceptionally fine
specimens. I was very much embarrassed, yet I did not
want to give offense by refusing them. I sent Mr. Gargiulo,
our veteran dragoman, to explain to the Sultan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
secretary how much I appreciated this attention, but
as I was not permitted to accept the vases for myself I
would accept them for our National Museum at Washington.
That pleased the Sultan, and the vases now have
a place in our museum at the national capital.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As there was no need for hurrying home, we made a
few stops on the way, first at Vienna. The papers announced
our arrival at the Austrian capital, and I received
a note from Dr. Theodor Hertzl asking for an appointment.
I was glad of the opportunity to meet him, for I
had read much about him. I found him a man of attractive
appearance: a little above medium height, coal-black
beard and hair, very dark, expressive, bright eyes. He
was about forty years old, seemed full of energy, beaming
with idealism, but a man of the world. He did not at
all impress one as a religious fanatic.</p>

<p>He said the idea of Zionism, or, rather, the colonization
of oppressed Jews, had been developing in his mind for
ten or twelve years. I told him I was not a Zionist,
though I did not want him to understand that I was in
any way opposed to the movement, or disposed carelessly
to ignore the solemn aspirations which the deeply religious
members of my race had prayerfully nurtured in
sorrow and suffering through the ages. In answer to his
question whether the Sultan had ever spoken with me
about the subject, I told him he had not, as he probably
understood it was not an American question and did not
in any way come under my jurisdiction. But I told
Hertzl of my negotiations regarding the immigration of
the Jews to Palestine during my first mission to Turkey,
when I visited Jerusalem.</p>

<p>We spoke of the condition brought about through the
agitation of Zionism, the immigration of hundreds of Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
without means into Palestine, where there was as yet no
industry to enable them to make a livelihood. He said he
appreciated that and was doing everything in his power
to prevent such immigration until a permit for a "chartered
company" with sufficient capital had been obtained
from the Sultan, and that he was in correspondence with
an official of the Porte for the securing of such a permit.
I suggested that it might be best for him to go to Constantinople
and personally take up such negotiations; that I
had been shown a letter from him to Artin Effendi, the
under-Secretary of State, and this man was one of the
biggest rogues in the empire, an Armenian kept nominally
in office by the Sultan to mislead and hold in check his
oppressed co-religionists. Dr. Hertzl thought he might
take my advice.</p>

<p>He informed me that some months before, he had taken
the matter up with the German Emperor and was led to
believe that the Emperor was not in any way opposed to
Zionism, nor to the returning of the Jews to Palestine,
but Dr. Hertzl feared the opposition of the Catholics. He
gathered also, from what he had heard, that Russia did
not oppose the plan.</p>

<p>I mentioned Mesopotamia to him as a better place for
the colonization of the Jews than Palestine; it was the
original home of Abraham and his progenitors, was
sparsely settled, and if the ancient canals were reopened
that country could support several million people. He
said he was somewhat familiar with this idea, as well as
with Professor Haupt's pamphlet, and a scheme for the
colonization of Cyprus, and that it was perhaps well to
have more than one plan; if one did not serve as an outlet
for emigration another might.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Hertzl was one of those men who,
having capacity and idealism, attach themselves to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
cause that appeals to their intellect or their sympathies,
and grow in spirit and effectiveness through the intensity
of their devotion. Such men often develop extraordinary
qualities of true greatness under conditions that impose
weighty responsibilities, to an extent which they themselves
did not realize.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We next went to Rome. All my life I had looked forward
to visiting "Imperial Rome" on her seven hills, the
old Rome that inspired some of the leading chapters of
the world's history. And my imagination was fired the
more because in my mind's eye I carried for comparison a
picture of Athens, city of Pallas Athene, once proud intellectual
mistress of the world; Jerusalem, from whence
emanated the spiritual endowment of civilization; and
the new Rome to which Constantine brought the scepter
of the world.</p>

<p>While in Rome we were entertained by our ambassador
and Mrs. Draper. They were occupying Palazzo
Piombino, one of the most magnificent of the newer
palaces, where they entertained in a manner befitting
their station. We met there several of my former colleagues
at Constantinople who were now representing
their governments in Rome. Moses Ezekiel, our distinguished
American sculptor, was also in Rome at this
time, and with him and Mr. Bonney, in charge of the excavations
of the Forum then in process, we went through
the recently excavated chambers of the vestal virgins.</p>

<p>Before leaving the city we were received by the beautiful
and charming Queen Margherita. She was a remarkably
well-informed woman, even about events in our
country. She spoke about the American press, and said
one of our papers had a correspondent in Rome who was
an ardent supporter of papal rule and could see no virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in the Italian Government. She referred to the invention
of the flying machine by Professor Langley, of the Smithsonian
Institution, which, if it proved a success, would
ultimately change the life of all peoples, which she hoped
would bring the nations nearer to one another and into
closer spiritual contact.</p>

<p>We visited Pompeii, and then went to Naples, where
we boarded a steamer for New York, arriving home on
February 8, 1900.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Immediately I went to Washington for a conference
with Secretary Hay and to give him the details of the
various negotiations. He was especially interested in the
communication of the Sultan to the Sulu Mohammedans,
for the friendly relations that this established between
the Sulus and our Government had already prevented the
shedding of blood.</p>

<p>I told Secretary Hay that I desired to resign. The
matters for which I had been sent to Turkey were adjusted,
the payment of the indemnity being only a question
of time and patience; on the other hand, it was important,
so far as concerned my personal affairs, that
I be relieved from further duty abroad, especially as I
could not in Turkey properly give to my children the
education I felt they should have. The secretary thought
my request reasonable and just, but he thought the
President would regret it and would have difficulty in
replacing me.</p>

<p>I took the subject up with the President next day. He
said he realized I had made sacrifices enough and was
entitled to have my wishes respected; he did not, however,
wish me to send in my resignation just yet, but to continue,
for a time at least, to direct matters in Turkey in
consultation with Secretary Hay. He expressed great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
satisfaction with the result of my mission and said if he
hadn't sent me, some hostile demonstration in Turkish
waters would have been inevitable, with possible serious
complications as a result; but that the clamoring for a
warship to Turkey subsided with my going over because
of the general belief that I would succeed in handling
matters. "No one else could have done so well; you have
done better than I thought it possible for any one to do,"
he graciously added.</p>

<p>He indicated that there might develop some important
post in the United States which he should like to feel free
to ask me to accept should the occasion arise, but he
made no further explanation. I later learned from St.
Clair McKelway to what this had reference. McKelway
was on intimate terms with the President and at the
same time was a close friend of mine. The President
mentioned to him that he feared Secretary Hay, whose
health was failing, might have to relinquish his post, in
which event McKinley had in mind to offer it to me.</p>

<p>Within a week after my return I received a letter from
Charles C. Harrison, provost of the University of Pennsylvania,
informing me that the trustees had unanimously
voted to confer upon me the honorary degree of Doctor
of Laws, and he would be glad if it were convenient for me
to receive the degree at a convocation of unusual importance
on Washington's Birthday. This ceremony took
place at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, and similar
degrees were conferred also upon Justice Harlan, of the
United States Supreme Court; Professor Ames, of the
Harvard Law School; Minister Wu, of China; President
Diaz, of Mexico; and two delegates from the Universities
of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>From time to time during the next few months I went
to Washington both to direct Turkish matters through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the State Department and to confer with the President on
matters in general. On one of these occasions, in August,
he mentioned his forthcoming letter of acceptance of renomination
and spoke about the efforts of the Democrats
to fasten the charge of imperialism on the administration,
but said he would make it plain that we proposed to give
as much freedom of government and independence to the
Philippines as they showed themselves able to receive.
I read to him from a memorandum I had drawn up regarding
our purpose to withdraw our troops as fast and in
proportion as the conditions of peace in the islands permitted.
He said I had expressed his ideas exactly, and as
I was about to replace the memorandum in my pocket he
said he wished I would let him have it, which of course I
did.</p>

<p>He asked what I thought of conditions in China, and I
told him I was convinced our true course was to oppose
the partition of that country and to stand firm for the
open-door policy; that if Germany, or any other Power,
endeavored to bring about a division, we could doubtless
prevent it by insisting upon the open door, especially as
the nations could not agree among themselves.</p>

<p>Early in December I received a letter from Secretary
Hay, asking whether I still preferred to be relieved or
whether for any reason I would consent to continue as minister
to Turkey. I definitely answered in the negative and
my second mission terminated with the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="signature">

<br />
<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I have laid before the President your letter of the 12th instant,
in which you express your preference not to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Constantinople, and offer your resignation of the mission you
have honorably and faithfully filled for the past few years.</p>

<p>Deferring to your wish, the President has accepted your
resignation. In charging me to inform you of this acceptance,
the President desires me to make known in fitting words his
high appreciation of the valuable services you have rendered to
your country, and his sense of the ability and intelligence you
have brought to bear in the performance of a task of more than
usual delicacy and difficulty. Called, as you were, a second
time to the Ottoman mission and confronted by the problems
and entanglements that seem to especially environ that post,
you have shown rare aptness in dealing with its perplexities and
have notably strengthened the hands of the government in
leading the long pending questions toward a settlement. While
deeply regretting your retirement and while averse to losing
your helpful counsels, the President has felt that he could not
rightfully impose fresh personal sacrifices upon you by disregarding
your wish. You take with you into honored private life
the esteem of those who have known and understood your conscientious
worth in the paths of official duty.</p>

<p>I share the President's regrets and equally share his appreciation
of the good services you have rendered. My sincere regards
and personal friendship are with you always.</p>

<p>I began the year 1901 as a private citizen once more. I
devoted much of my time, however, to public activities,
giving close attention particularly to the international
questions that arose.</p>

<p>The doctrine of citizenship and the rights of naturalized
American citizens in foreign countries had for many
years formed the major subject in our foreign relations,
and it had been one for constant controversy between our
own and foreign countries, especially Germany, Austria,
and Turkey. In the spring I read a paper at a meeting of
the American Social Science Association, of which I was
the president, entitled "The United States Doctrine of
Citizenship and Expatriation." Later in the year I received,
in consequence, a letter from Senator S. M. Cullom
of Illinois, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations, asking me to prepare material for
amendments to legislation on this subject, which I did.</p>

<p>When Theodore Roosevelt became President of the
United States through the lamentable death of William
McKinley, one of my earliest relations with him was my
being appointed by him as a member of the Permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Court of Arbitration at The Hague. Whether or not he
acted herein in conformity with McKinley's intention, I
cannot say. When McKinley was selecting the original
members, he conferred with me and indicated that if
agreeable to me, he would be pleased to appoint me as
a member. Shortly afterward when the appointments
were announced, my name was not among them. It was
some time before I saw him again, and while I should
never have mentioned it, he did. He said he was very
sorry that through the pressure of duties he had quite forgotten
his intention to name me when the time came to
announce the appointments. I told him I thought perhaps
I had been mistaken in understanding that he had
offered me one of the appointments. He said I had not
misunderstood, but that he would make amends should a
vacancy occur while he was still President; he had wanted
me as a member of the Court, not alone in recognition of
the great services I had rendered, but because he regarded
me exceptionally qualified. He added that when
he became ex-President he would like to be a member of
that Court himself; it appealed to him more than any
other office he could think of.</p>

<p>The vacancy in the membership of the Court occurred
sooner than any one anticipated, by the death, in March,
1901, of ex-President Harrison; but by the decree of the
gods McKinley himself was no longer with us when the
time came to fill President Harrison's place. In fact I
think the day we talked about the Court marked my last
conference with him. He was always simple in manner
and of charming personality. Together we enjoyed a
good smoke that afternoon; he was fond of smoking and
knew I enjoyed a good cigar, and he was wont to have me
take one of his brand. I begged him not to concern himself
further with the omission of my appointment at The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Hague, that I was satisfied to know he thought me
worthy of the selection.</p>

<p>It is possible that Roosevelt knew the circumstance and
McKinley's intention, for he was Vice-President at the
time it happened. At any rate, when the successor to
President Harrison was chosen, I received the following
appointment, somewhat different in form from most
documents of the kind:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="signature2"><span class="smcap">White House</span>
</div>
<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>January</i> 8, 1902
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Article XX of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of
International Disputes, signed July 29, 1899, by the Plenipotentiaries
to the Hague Peace Conference, provides for the
organization of a permanent Court of Arbitration, and Article
XXIII of the same Convention provides for the selection by
each of the signatory Powers of four persons at the most, as
members of the Court, who are to be appointed for a term of
six years.</p>

<p>It will give me pleasure to designate you as one of the four
United States members if you will advise me that such action
is agreeable to you.</p>

<p class="center">
Very Truly Yours,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Honorable Oscar S. Straus</span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New York, N.Y.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Since then I have been reappointed three times: in
1908, again by Roosevelt, in 1912 and 1920, by Wilson.</p>

<p>In April, 1902, there appeared in the press a dispatch
to the effect that an expedition of twelve hundred men
was to be sent to the southern Philippines to punish the
Mohammedans there for killing one of our soldiers and
wounding several others. I immediately wrote the
President that I believed such a step would be unwise
and would probably bring on a general uprising in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
province. I called his attention to the negotiation I had
had with the Sultan of Turkey regarding these people,
and suggested that instead of the expedition a commission
be sent to treat with them. The President asked me
to come to Washington to confer with him in the matter,
and after the Cabinet meeting I met him in his study.
There were present also Mr. Taft, who had been appointed
governor of the Philippines, Adjutant-General
Corbin, and Mr. Sanger, acting Secretary of War. I
presented my arguments more fully. The President had
already telegraphed General Chaffee regarding the sending
of a diplomatic mission, in accordance with my letter.</p>

<p>The result of our conference was that General Corbin
was directed to advise General Chaffee to use the office
of the friendly datos to obtain the desired redress. It
developed later that the soldier killed was laying a
telegraph line, which procedure, not being understood by
the Moros, was regarded by them as a device for their
destruction. The slayers were surrendered and punished
and the incident was satisfactorily adjusted.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At about this time disturbances in Roumania were
being reflected in our country. Eleven years before, a
committee of prominent Jews had brought before President
Harrison the pitiable condition of the large number
of Jews arriving in New York from Russia, and it was
now necessary to take similar steps with regard to the
Jews from Roumania.</p>

<p>In Chapter IV I mentioned that Roumania disregarded
the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin and placed
restrictions upon her Jewish subjects. Into that treaty,
by which Roumania was made an independent kingdom
following the Russo-Turkish War, Article XLIV
was inserted specially for the protection of the Jews, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
whom there were about four hundred thousand in the
new state. It provided that difference of religion should
not be ground for exclusion in the participation of civil,
political, or economic rights. In spite of this, however,
the Jews in Roumania were being oppressed and discriminated
against on the specious claim that they were
foreigners, though they and their ancestors had been
living in the land for generations. They were compelled
to serve in the army, but not permitted to become officers;
they were made subject to exceptional taxes; they were
excluded from the professions and from owning and
cultivating land. In every direction they were being
throttled, and new laws were being promulgated to shut
off every avenue of self-support.</p>

<p>The result was what had doubtless been the intention
in putting into force these drastic measures: the Jews who
could emigrated, and they left Roumania <i>en masse</i>. The
obstacles in the way of their gaining admission into the
countries of Western Europe were so great that few of
them could settle there. The leading Jewish organizations
of Great Britain and France, namely, the Jewish
Colonization Association in London and the Alliance
Israélite Universelle in Paris, laid the matter before their
respective governments, but, on account of the disturbed
conditions in the Balkans and the cross-currents of European
politics, no pressure could be exerted through these
governments.</p>

<p>The main stream of the Roumanian exodus was thus
directed to America, and they arrived here in increasing
numbers. The leading Jewish agencies of the country,
particularly the B'nai B'rith Order under the presidency
of Leo N. Levi, used their best efforts to distribute the
immigrants over the country and to places where they
were most likely to find employment. Later our very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
able commissioner of immigration at Ellis Island, Robert
Watchorn, went over to Roumania for the special purpose
of studying the situation and made a graphic report
of what he learned. But to alleviate the situation
action of a more official character was needed.</p>

<p>Jacob H. Schiff and I prepared a careful brief on conditions
and presented it to President Roosevelt. The
President said he was willing to take the matter in hand
provided something could be done by our Government.
Congressman Lucius N. Littauer also extended helpful
coöperation. He had recently returned from Roumania
and had first-hand knowledge of the question, which he
took up in conferences with the President and with
Secretary Hay.</p>

<p>Finally, in September, 1902, the President directed
Secretary Hay to prepare his now famous Roumanian
Note to the Powers signatory to the Treaty of Berlin.
The note was sent to our diplomatic representatives in
those countries with instructions to present it to the
governments to which they were accredited. The occasion
for sending it was found in connection with negotiations
initiated by Roumania for the concluding of a
naturalization treaty with our country. The note gave
the reasons why, under the circumstances, we were unwilling
to conclude such a treaty. After referring to the
Treaty of Berlin and the obligations assumed by Roumania
under it regarding the treatment of subject nationalities,
the Secretary said:</p>

<blockquote><p>The United States offers asylum to the oppressed of all lands.
But its sympathy with them in no wise impairs its just liberty
and right to weigh the acts of the oppressor in the light of their
effects upon this country, and to judge accordingly.</p>

<p>Putting together the facts, now painfully brought home to
this Government, during the past few years, that many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
inhabitants of Roumania are being forced by artificially adverse
discriminations to quit their native country; that the hospitable
asylum offered by this country is almost the only refuge left to
them; that they come hither unfitted by the conditions of their
exile to take part in the new life of this land under circumstances
either profitable to themselves or beneficial to the community,
and that they are objects of charity from the outset and for a
long time&mdash;the right of remonstrance against the acts of the
Roumanian Government is clearly established in favor of this
Government. Whether consciously and of purpose or not,
these helpless people, burdened and spurned by their native
land, are forced by the sovereign power of Roumania upon the
charity of the United States. This Government can not be a
tacit party to such an international wrong. It is constrained to
protest against the treatment to which the Jews of Roumania
are subjected, not alone because it has unimpeachable ground
to remonstrate against the resultant injury to itself, but in the
name of humanity. The United States may not authoritatively
appeal to the stipulations of the treaty of Berlin, to which it
was not and can not become a signatory, but it does earnestly
appeal to the principles consigned therein, because they are the
principles of international law and eternal justice, advocating
the broad toleration which that solemn compact enjoins and
standing ready to lend its moral support to the fulfillment
thereof by its cosignatories, for the act of Roumania itself has
effectively joined the United States to them as an interested
party in this regard.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most valuable by-products of the Congress
of Berlin was to bring into closer relations the autocratic
with the liberal governments of Europe and cause the
former to become more amenable to the enlightened conscience
of the world. Hay's dispatch, while not pleasing to
the Government of Roumania, yet, because of the world-wide
publicity it received, had a measure of influence
in modifying Roumania's indefensible proscriptions.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another need for humanitarian diplomacy arose the
following year. The attitude and proscriptions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Roumanian authorities had doubtless encouraged anti-Semitic
activity in Russia, and the latter Government,
no longer contenting itself with the application of restrictions
in the book of laws which compelled Jews to
live in the Pale settlements, officially encouraged mobs
to massacre and loot, culminating on April 19-20, 1903,
with the outbreak in Kishineff, where forty-seven Jews
were killed, ninety-two severely wounded, and some five
hundred more slightly injured. In addition great material
losses were inflicted: seven hundred houses were
destroyed, six hundred stores pillaged, and thousands of
families utterly ruined.</p>

<p>When these facts became known, they called forth an
expression of indignation throughout the civilized world.
In New York a mass meeting was called at Carnegie Hall
by hundreds of the foremost New York Christians, in
protest against the outrages upon the Jews in Russia
and particularly against the Kishineff affair. The meeting
was presided over by Paul D. Cravath, eminent
lawyer, and the speakers were ex-President Cleveland,
Mayor Seth Low, Jacob G. Schurman, president of
Cornell, and Edward M. Shepard, well known for his
unselfish devotion to the interests of the public. I have in
my possession the manuscript of Cleveland's address on
this occasion, which concludes:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the meantime, let the people of the United States, gathered
together in such assemblages as this in every part of the
land, fearlessly speak to the civilized world&mdash;protesting against
every pretence of civilization that permits mediæval persecution,
against every bigoted creed that forbids religious toleration
and freedom of conscience, against all false enlightenment
that excuses hatred and cruelty towards any race of men, and
against all spurious forms of government protection, that
withhold from any human being the right to live in safety, and
toil in peace.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>I will also quote part of the resolutions adopted that
evening:</p>

<blockquote><p>Resolved, that the people of the United States should exercise
such influence with the Government of Russia as the ancient
and unbroken friendship between the two nations may
justify to stay the spirit of persecution, to redress the injuries
inflicted upon the Jews of Kishineff, and to prevent the recurrence
of outbreaks such as have amazed the civilized world.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few weeks later a committee from the B'nai B'rith
Order, consisting of Simon Wolf, Adolf Moses, Julius
Bien, Jacob Furth, Solomon Sulzberger, and Joseph D.
Coons, and headed by their president, Leo N. Levi, called
upon Secretary Hay and presented to him a statement
regarding the massacres in Russia together with a proposed
petition which they wished forwarded to the Government
of the Czar. The Secretary expressed great
sympathy and the desire to do what might be possible in
the matter. His reply to the committee, taken down in
shorthand at the time, was published in full in the press,
and from it I quote the concluding sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>All we know of the state of things in Russia tends to justify
the hope that even out of the present terrible situation some
good results may come; that He who watches over Israel does
not slumber, and that the wrath of man now, as so often in the
past, shall be made to praise Him.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Secretary then accompanied the committee to the
White House, where they met the President and presented
to him an outline of the oppression of their co-religionists
in Russia.</p>

<p>Early in July I received a telegram from the President's
secretary to the effect that the President would like to
have me lunch with him the day following at Oyster Bay,
and that Simon Wolf of Washington, and Leo N. Levi
also had been invited. When I arrived at Sagamore Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
there were present besides those named Dr. Albert Shaw
of the "Review of Reviews," and an English friend of
his, Mr. Morris Sheldon Amos.</p>

<p>We discussed the Russian situation throughout lunch.
The President suggested that a note be sent by the Secretary
of State to John W. Riddle, our chargé at St. Petersburg,
and that this note should embody the entire petition
which Mr. Levi and his committee had drafted. Dr.
Shaw observed that the embodying of the petition to the
Czar and giving publicity to the note would have all the
effects of a presentation even if the Czar should refuse to
receive it, which was exactly what the President had in
mind.</p>

<p>After luncheon we adjourned to the study, and Roosevelt
said: "Now let's finish this thing up." Hay had been
to see him the day before and had left a memorandum.
Roosevelt at once drafted the note with his own pen,
using part of Hay's memorandum. The note was to
be sent as an open cable. It read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Riddle</span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; St. Petersburg</p>

<p>You are instructed to ask an audience of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs and to make to him the following communication:</p>

<p><i>Excellency</i>: The Secretary of State instructs me to inform you
that the President has received from a large number of prominent
citizens of the United States of all religious affiliations,
and occupying the highest positions in both public and private
life, a respectful petition addressed to his Majesty the Emperor
relating to the condition of the Jews in Russia and running as
follows:</p>

<p>[Here is set out the petition.]</p>

<p>I am instructed to ask whether the petition will be received
by your Excellency to be submitted to the gracious consideration
of his Majesty. In that case the petition will be at once
forwarded to St. Petersburg.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Roosevelt wanted the cable to be sent at once and was
in a hurry to get it to Washington. One of his reasons was
that the late Russian ambassador, Cassini, had been dismissed
and was on his way back to Russia, and he wanted
the note to reach the Russian Government before Cassini
arrived in St. Petersburg. Mr. Wolf, who lived in Washington,
was to take the drafted cable to Secretary Hay;
but as he could not return that night the President asked
whether I could take it so that it might be dispatched
next morning. By ten o'clock the following morning I
placed the draft in the Secretary's hands and it was immediately
put on the wire.</p>

<p>In planning the cable as he did, the President was
right in his anticipation. Duly the American chargé at
St. Petersburg informed the State Department that the
Russian Government, through its Minister of Foreign
Affairs, had declined to receive or consider the petition.
Nevertheless, its purpose was accomplished. Official
Russia was made to realize the aroused indignation and
the public protests of the civilized world. This in turn had
a decided influence in checking, for the time being at
least, similar outbreaks threatened throughout the empire,
besides bringing to trial and punishment some of
the leaders of the massacres.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That afternoon at Sagamore Hill, after the Russian
matter had been disposed of, the President was talking to
Dr. Shaw and me about the Alaskan boundary question.
He pulled out a map showing the disputed boundary, and
explained that three commissioners from the United States
and three from Great Britain and Canada would take
up the dispute for investigation. He argued that they
were not arbiters and he refused to sign an arbitral agreement;
if they did not agree, he would take the matter into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
his own hands; that the whole trouble arose from the fact
that the Canadians had shoved down the boundary line
after the discovery of gold. "Suppose a man pitches a
tent on my grounds and claims them, and I want him to
get off; and he says he won't get off, but will arbitrate
the matter!" Roosevelt exclaimed. Then, turning to me,
he added: "Straus, you are a member of the Hague Tribunal;
don't you think I'm right?"</p>

<p>I calmly replied that as a member of the Hague Tribunal
I should first have to hear what the other side had
to say and therefore must reserve my judgment. And we
all had a good laugh.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the Venezuela controversy in 1902, Venezuela
on the one side and Great Britain and Germany on the
other, Roosevelt was very much incensed that Germany,
with the feeble backing of England, should undertake a
blockade against Venezuela to make the latter carry out
certain agreements, and he promptly took steps to prevent
it. Thereupon there was a disposition on the part of
Germany to ask Roosevelt to arbitrate. Secretary Hay,
it seems, favored such a course, but I strongly advised
against it.</p>

<p>At a luncheon to which I was invited by the President
early in November, 1903, the conditions in Panama came
up as the principal topic of conversation. There were
present on this occasion, besides Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt,
Cornelius N. Bliss, former Secretary of the Interior;
John Clark Davis, of the "Philadelphia Ledger"; H. H.
Kohlsaat, of Chicago; Lawrence F. Abbott, of "The Outlook";
and the President's brother-in-law, Lieutenant-Commander
Cowles, of the Navy. News had been received
that Panama had separated from Colombia and
we were about to recognize Panama. In his informal way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as was his custom at luncheons, the President began to
discuss the situation, referring to the fact that our treaty
of 1846 was with New Granada, which afterwards became
the United States of Colombia and then the Republic of
Colombia, and that in that treaty we had guaranteed to
protect the transit route. One of the questions raised was
whether the treaty still held us to that obligation, notwithstanding
these several changes of sovereignty.</p>

<p>The President was directing his remarks toward me,
which was his way of signifying the particular person
from whom he wanted to draw comment. I answered
that it seemed to me, as I recollected the terms of the
treaty, which I had recently read, that the change of
sovereignty did not affect either our obligations or our
rights; that I regarded them in the nature of a "covenant
running with the land."</p>

<p>"That's fine! Just the idea!" Roosevelt replied, and
as soon as luncheon was over, he requested me to express
that idea to Hay. He scratched a few lines on a
correspondence card asking Secretary Hay to go over
with me the suggestion I had made and to work into
the treaty the "covenant running with the land"
idea.</p>

<p>That evening I called on the Secretary. He seized the
idea at once and said he would make use of it in a statement
he was just preparing for the press detailing the
whole situation. The following day there was reported
in the papers of the country the fact that the President,
following a meeting of the Cabinet, had decided to recognize
the <i>de facto</i> government of Panama; and then the
detailed statement by Secretary Hay regarding the terms
of the treaty, the history of the negotiations, and the subsequent
development, covered several newspaper columns.
It contained this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>It must not be lost sight of that this treaty is not dependent
for its efficacy on the personnel of the signers or the name of
the territory it affects. It is a covenant, as lawyers say, that
runs with the land. The name of New Granada has passed
away; its territory has been divided. But as long as the isthmus
endures, the great geographical fact keeps alive the solemn
compact which binds the holders of the territory to grant us
freedom of transit, and binds us in return to safeguard for the
isthmus and the world the exercise of that inestimable privilege.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few days thereafter I received a short note from the
President reading: "Your 'covenant running with the
land' idea worked admirably. I congratulate you on it."
And from my friend John Bassett Moore I received an
amusing letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>So you had a finger in the pie! I find a good deal of amusement
in reflecting on the end reached from the premise of my
memorandum; and almost as much on the conclusion reached
from your suggestion. Perhaps, however, it is only a question
of words&mdash;that is to say, it is, indifferently, a question of the
"covenant running with the land" or a question of the "covenant
running (<i>away!</i>) with the land"!!</p></blockquote>

<p>Those luncheons at the White House were always
pleasant and interesting occasions. One met there all
kinds of people, of every station in life, but always people
who stood for something and who interested the President.
At the table Roosevelt would speak without apparent
reserve and free from all official restraint, and I doubt
whether these confidences were ever abused. By this
means, too, he received the frank, unreserved statements
and criticisms of his guests.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the range of personalities one
would meet at the Roosevelt luncheons, I remember one
day when Seth Bullock, a former sheriff of the Black
Hills district and an intimate friend of Roosevelt during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
his cowboy days, sat next to Seth Low at the table. And
in his "Autobiography" Roosevelt himself says:</p>

<blockquote><p>No guests were ever more welcome at the White House than
these old friends of the cattle ranches and the cow camps&mdash;the
men with whom I had ridden the long circle and eaten at
the tail-board of a chuck-wagon&mdash;whenever they turned up at
Washington during my Presidency. I remember one of them
who appeared at Washington one day just before lunch, a huge,
powerful man who, when I knew him, had been distinctly a
fighting character. It happened that on that day another old
friend, the British Ambassador, Mr. Bryce, was among those
coming to lunch. Just before we went in I turned to my
cow-puncher friend and said to him with great solemnity,
"Remember, Jim, that if you shot at the feet of the British
Ambassador to make him dance, it would be likely to cause
international complications"; to which Jim responded, with
unaffected horror, "Why, Colonel, I shouldn't think of it,
I shouldn't think of it!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Roosevelt is a most charming and cultured
woman, typically the wife and mother. Literary and intellectual
matters appeal to her, though her dominant
note is the domestic one. I am sure she would have been
just as happy as the mistress of a private household as
the leading lady of the land in the White House, despite
her great tact, sweetness, and simple dignity in filling
the latter position.</p>

<p>The President was an omnivorous reader. He could
read faster and remember better than any one I have
ever known. On one occasion he recommended to me
Ferrero's "Greatness and Decline of Rome," which he
had just finished in the original Italian, and which had
been brought out in English by the Putnam house. Subsequently,
too, I met this author at the White House,
where he and his wife were the guests of the President
for several days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>In January, 1904, a large conference was held in Washington
of representatives of the various peace societies
and other persons prominently interested in the calling
of an international peace congress. George F. Seward,
of New York, was chairman, and others connected with
it were the Reverend Edward Everett Hale and Robert
Treat Paine, of Boston; Henry St. George Tucker, of
Virginia, Andrew Carnegie, and myself. Resolutions
were adopted recommending the negotiation of a treaty
with Great Britain whereby all differences between us
which might fail of adjustment through diplomatic
channels were to be submitted for arbitration to the
Permanent Court at The Hague. It was further recommended
that we enter into like treaties with other powers
as soon as practicable. We called on the President and
the resolutions were presented by Mr. Tucker; Mr. Carnegie
and I each made a few remarks, which the President
in turn answered with a brief address. When he had
finished and we were all standing around him, Mr. Carnegie
said to him, "I have just been congratulating Mr.
Straus on the compliments you paid him, and suggested
that he get a copy of that portion of your remarks to
preserve for his children and grandchildren." Roosevelt
immediately turned to Mr. Loeb, his secretary, and instructed
him to send to me that portion of his remarks,
adding: "And I meant every word I said." I trust I may
be pardoned for the egotism which prompts me to incorporate
it in these memoirs:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have had from Mr. Straus aid that I can not over-estimate,
for which I can not too much express my gratitude, in so much
of the diplomatic work that has arisen in this administration&mdash;aid
by suggestion, aid by actual work in helping me to carry
out the suggestions; and Mr. Straus was one of the two or three
men who first set my mind, after I came in as President, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
direction of doing everything that could be done for the Hague
Tribunal, as that seemed to be the best way to turn for arbitration.</p></blockquote>

<p>At another pleasant luncheon there was present Alice,
now the wife of Congressman Longworth, of Ohio, Roosevelt's
daughter by his first wife. In the course of our
discussion about the reciprocity treaty with Cuba and
the making of more favorable tariff arrangements, I said:
"We went to war with Spain for the liberation of Cuba,
and now if we treat her step-motherly and starve her to
death, what would the world say?" There was hearty
laughter all round the table, and Miss Alice turned to me
and said, in her naïve way and with a mischievous sparkle
in her eyes: "Do I look starved?" The President had
fairly exploded with laughter, and when I remarked that
I had "put my foot into it," he added, amid another outburst,
"Yes, both of them!"</p>

<p>The President did not smoke, but always served cigars
and cigarettes to his guests. When I did not take one,
he said, "Straus, you smoke."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "but I certainly want to pay as
much respect to you as I always did to the Sultan of
Turkey. He did not drink, and I never took any when it
was served."</p>

<p>"You go right ahead and smoke. If Root were here he
would smoke and always does," replied Roosevelt.</p>

<p>After lunch that day, when the other guests had gone, he
and I went into an adjoining room and had a general discussion&mdash;labor
matters, the National Civic Federation,
the Republican Party, etc., etc. He said he had received
a number of requests to put into the Republican platform
a plank protesting against the discrimination made by
Russia against Americans of the Jewish faith. "You
know," he said, "I am prepared to do anything that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
can for all of our citizens regardless of race or creed, but
unless we mean to do something further than simply protest
it would look like an effort to catch votes, for such
statements in the platform could not be regarded for any
other purpose." He added he had in mind a different and
more effective way of handling the subject when the time
came. He said he remembered that I had never asked
him to take action in this or any other question that was
not justified on broad American principles, but that if
anything arose which specially reflected upon the Jews
he looked to me to bring it to his attention, and I was to
regard that just as much my duty as the protection of
American Christian interests in Turkey.</p>

<p>We spoke about the Russo-Japanese War, and I told
him that some one had said that the Japs were yellow-skinned,
but the Russians were yellow all the way through.
This called forth a hearty laugh. Humor of any kind,
provided it was clean, he always appreciated, and his own
sense of it continually served, as it did for Lincoln, to
lighten the seriousness of his duties.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Like Lincoln, too, Roosevelt combined with that balancing
sense of humor an innate and always active sense
of justice. Time and again in my relationship with him
I have observed and admired it. I recall in this regard the
case of an employee named Miller in the Government
Printing Office, who was discharged because he did not
belong to the union, and Roosevelt reinstated him. Mr.
Gompers and several members of the Executive Committee
of the American Federation of Labor thereupon
called upon the President to protest against this reinstatement.
They said his discharge was based on two
points: that he was a non-union man, and also that he
was an incapable worker. Roosevelt's answer was: "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
question of his personal fitness is one to be settled in the
routine of administrative detail, and cannot be allowed to
conflict with or to complicate the larger question of governmental
discrimination for or against him or any other
man because he is or is not a member of a union. This is
the only question now before me for decision; and as to
this my decision is final."</p>

<p>As I was in constant touch with the President by correspondence
and conferences, I wrote him telling of my
gratification to find in his decision anent the Miller case
such consonance in principle with his position regarding
the anthracite coal strike, to which I received the following
reply that brings out the point I have just made
about his sense of justice:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<span class="smcap">White House, Washington</span><br />
<i>October</i> 1, 1903
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I thank you heartily for your letter. When you can get on
here I should like to tell you for your own information some
of my experiences in connection with this Miller case. I feel
exactly as you do&mdash;that my action was a complement to my
action, for instance, in the anthracite coal strike, and that I
could no more hesitate in the teeth of opposition from the
labor unions in one case, than I could when the opposition came
from the big monied men in the other case.</p>

<p class="center">
Sincerely yours</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps no President has had a policy, with regard to
labor, so wise and far-seeing as that of Roosevelt. Invariably
he sought the counsel of labor leaders in matters
affecting their interests, and always they were made to
feel that redress for their just grievances, and their rights
generally, were as much a concern of his and of his administration
as any rights of the rich. In this connection I recall
a remark of P. H. Morrissey, then head of the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
train-men. We were seated in the Red Room of the White
House for conference after dinner. There were present
some thirty or more men prominently identified with
labor, whom the President had invited to discuss labor
legislation. Morrissey recalled one time several years
before when he sat in front of the great fireplace in the
Red Room waiting for the President; and he said he
could not help reflecting what a long way it was from the
cab of the locomotive engine to this stately room in the
official residence of the President of the United States, an
honor and a privilege that Roosevelt was the first President
to give to men of labor.</p>

<p>On the same evening I saw in clear relief Roosevelt's
wonderful tact, judgment, and understanding of men as
I had never seen it displayed before. One or two of the
labor leaders showed some bitterness in their criticism of
certain legislation. Roosevelt showed frank approval of
just complaints and allayed irritation in a most tactful
way where the demand was unjust or unreasonable.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the election of 1904 I took an active part and kept in
close touch with Roosevelt. An unusual amount of bitterness
characterized this campaign, though it was foreseen
that Roosevelt would win by a large majority. In
this connection I received a characteristic letter from him,
dated at the White House October 15th:</p>

<blockquote><p>I notice that various Democratic papers, including the Evening
Post, have endeavored to show that I have appealed to the
Jew vote, the Catholic vote, etc. Now the fact is that I have
not appealed to any man as Jew, as Protestant, or as Catholic,
but that I have as strongly as in me lies endeavored to make it
evident that each is to have a square deal, no more and no less,
without regard to his creed. I hope that this country will continue
in substantially its present form of government for many
centuries. If this is so it is reasonable to suppose that during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that time there will be Presidents of Jewish faith, Presidents of
Catholic faith. Now, my aim as President is to behave toward
the Jew and the Catholic just as I should wish a Jewish or
Catholic President to behave towards Protestants&mdash;in other
words, to behave as a good American should behave toward all
his fellow Americans, without regard to the several creeds they
profess or the several lands from which their ancestors have
sprung. Moreover, I am pleased at what Lebowich says at my
not having a spirit of condescension or patronizing. I have
enough of the old Adam in me to object almost as strongly to
being patronized as to being wronged; and I do not intend knowingly
to behave toward others in a manner which I should resent
if it were adopted toward me.</p></blockquote>

<p>These sentences bring to mind another and public
statement of Roosevelt's in which he characterized
Americanism; the occasion was an address at the unveiling
of the Sheridan equestrian statue in Washington:</p>

<blockquote><p>We should keep steadily before our minds the fact that
Americanism is a question of principle, of purpose, of idealism,
of character; that it is not a matter of birthplace, or creed, or
line of descent.</p>

<p>Here in this country the representatives of many old-world
races are being fused together into a new type, a type the main
features of which are already determined, and were determined
at the time of the Revolutionary War; for the crucible in which
all the new types are melted into one was shaped from 1776 to
1789, and our nationality was definitely fixed in all its essentials
by the men of Washington's day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon after the election he invited me to come to the
White House for dinner one evening and to spend the
night; there were a number of things he wanted to talk
over with me. When I arrived I found Dr. Lyman Abbott
and his son Ernest had been similarly invited, and there
were additional guests for dinner: Attorney-General
Moody, Senator Knox, Secretary of War Taft, and James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
R. Garfield, chief of the Bureau of Corporations in the
Department of Commerce and Labor.</p>

<p>At dinner the President announced that we had come
together to do some business, and he produced from his
pocket a slip of paper on which were noted the several
subjects he wished to consider with us, mainly things to
be incorporated in his forthcoming Message to Congress.
First there was the negro question. The South had vilified
him because he entertained Booker Washington and
appointed Crum Collector of the Port at Charleston.
When Congress assembled, one of the things he intended
doing was to send in again the name of Crum for confirmation.
"The Southerners either do not or do not
wish to understand it," he said; adding that his position
plainly was that he would do everything in his power for
the white man South without, however, doing a wrong or
an injustice to the colored man. He was sympathetic
with the South, for he was half Southerner himself, his
mother having come from Roswell, Georgia. His remarks
on this topic were directed mainly to Dr. Abbott.</p>

<p>The conversation then turned to the recent election
and became very general, every one joining and relating
instances or experiences in connection with it. Mr. Taft,
who had waged a vigorous campaign for the Administration,
told a joke on himself: he had received a letter from
Wayne MacVeagh saying that so far as he (MacVeagh)
could see, Taft's speeches did not do any harm.</p>

<p>When the talk had gone along these general lines for
a while, Roosevelt interjected with "Now we must get
back to business," and proceeded to discuss the diplomatic
service in relation to his Message. He thought civil
service too strictly applied would be detrimental, as we
had a great deal of old timber there that should be gotten
rid of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>Next he took up a discussion of Panama. Mr. Taft
with several others was to leave next day on a mission
there to look into the difficulties between the native army
and the President of Panama, and some one humorously
suggested that he had better go down and take away the
weapons from the army and let them muster as much as
they wanted to without weapons.</p>

<p>After dinner we adjourned to the President's study on
the floor above. He sat down at his desk and pulled open
a drawer as he said: "I want to read to you incomplete
drafts of portions of my Message which I should like to
have you criticize, as on some of the subjects I have not
yet fully made up my mind." The Message was in separate
parts, each dealing with an important subject. He took
up the part dealing with our foreign relations, in regard
to Russia and Roumania, and addressed me, saying he
would like me to pay special attention to that as he had
consulted me all along concerning the action to be taken.
He said our Government had been criticized as interfering
with the internal affairs of other nations, and the
statement had been repeatedly made that we should not
like it if other nations took us to task for our negro lynchings
in the South; but he argued that the lynchings were
comparatively few, and, though bad enough, were nothing
compared to the wholesale murder in cold blood under
official sanction and perhaps instigation, as in Kishineff.
"My answer to all these criticisms is this," he said; "only
a short time ago I received a remonstrance or petition
from a society in Great Britain regarding the lynchings
in this country. I did not reject it; on the contrary, I
answered it most politely and expressed my great regret
for these unlawful, unjustifiable acts, with which neither
I nor the Government had any sympathy. On the contrary
the Government does everything in its power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
prevent these outrages and unlawful acts. And I authorize
any one to make use of this information whenever the
occasion presents itself."</p>

<p>To the labor question also he wanted me to pay special
attention because of my experience with such matters
and in the arbitration of labor disputes. He began with
the statement that he was in favor of organized capital
and organized labor. I asked him whether right at that
point I might make a suggestion, which was that he begin
with the general subject of capital and labor, because
organized labor did not comprise more than fifteen per
cent of the wage-earners of the country. This suggestion
he accepted.</p>

<p>Roosevelt then expressed himself in favor of the eight-hour
law. Messrs. Moody, Knox, Taft, and myself did
not agree with his statement in the form he had it. We
explained that there were several bills before Congress
on the subject, some of which had passed the lower house,
but were defeated in the Senate; that it was all right for
the Government in its own yards to adopt an eight-hour
day, but when it gave out contracts to other shops, while
it had a right to say that the work upon that contract
should be done by eight-hour days, it had no right to require
work on other contracts to be done in eight-hour
days. When we had discussed the subject quite thoroughly,
it was agreed to omit it from the Message.</p>

<p>Next he took up the trust question. He said Mr. Garfield
had several suggestions to offer for making the interstate
commerce law effective. It was generally agreed
that the law as originally passed fully provided the remedy
that was intended, but it had been emasculated by
the decisions of the Supreme Court. Messrs. Knox, Taft,
and Moody referred to several of these decisions and
pointed out that the railroads, under subterfuge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
switches and free cars&mdash;cars that were furnished by such
shippers as the beef trust&mdash;got completely around the
law. They allowed a mileage charge for the supply of
these cars in excess of what should be allowed, and under
such cover it amounted to a rebate to those shippers and
was a complete circumvention of the law. Garfield's suggestion
was that the interstate commerce corporations be
compelled to obtain a license or charter from the National
Government to do business. We thoroughly discussed
this, but it was disapproved as being an interference with
the legal rights of States, and that therefore no such law
could be passed by Congress. The President then turned
to the legal members of our group and said, "Now here
is a great wrong and you lawyers have always got a way
of preventing us from reaching a remedy."</p>

<p>Knox created a laugh by replying, "The President
wants us as usual to jump over the Supreme Court."</p>

<p>The work on the Message done, Roosevelt said it was
his intention to go South and make a few speeches. He
would begin at San Antonio and would visit Tuskegee and
Sewanee Colleges, for he wanted his views in regard to the
South and the negro question fully understood. He read
us a draft along the lines of thought he wanted to present,
quoting much from Lincoln, which seemed highly to the
point. When some one mentioned the curtailing of suffrage
so as to have it based upon educational qualifications
and property ownership, the President said it would
not be wise to agitate that subject, and that herein Booker
Washington agreed with him; but, he added, "There is
something inherently wrong about a Southern member
representing in some instances only a quarter of the
number of votes that an Eastern member represents, and
having an equal vote with him in Congress."</p>

<p>It was half after midnight when our little company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
separated. The President then suggested to Dr. Abbott
and me that we meet at 8.15 breakfast, if we did not
object to having this meal with him and the children.
In the absence of Mrs. Roosevelt, who had gone to New
York, the President next morning took the head of the
table, and with the coffee urn before him served us each
with our coffee, cream, and sugar. There were Teddy,
Ethel, Kermit, Archie, and Quentin, the governess, the
tutor, besides Dr. Abbott, his son, and myself. After the
meal we strolled in the park back of the White House until
9.30, when the President left for his work-room in the
new office building west of the White House.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I did not see Roosevelt again for several months. One
day in May I took lunch with him upon his return from
Chicago where he had had a conference with the representatives
of the labor unions who were carrying on the teamster's
strike that paralyzed the commerce of the city.
He said he had received through his secretary my memorandum
regarding an adjustment of the trouble, and
that it was of great assistance to him in discussing the
situation and coming to some equitable arrangement. He
was preparing a Message for an extra session of Congress
in October, and said he would send me parts of it, especially
those referring to immigration and the Far East, for
my advice and suggestion.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In 1905, when Roosevelt was busy with negotiations
to bring peace between Russia and Japan, I received a
letter from him stating that he had endeavored to get
these two nations to go to The Hague, but Russia was
most reluctant and Japan positively refused; nor would
they go to either Paris or Chefoo, but they were both
willing to come to Washington. In his own "Autobiography,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
which I never tire of reading, Roosevelt gives
an interesting sketch of his mediation between these two
countries which finally brought about the conference and
treaty at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Count Sergius Witte, head of the Russian mission to
Portsmouth, was desirous of meeting some of the representative
Jews of our country with a view to seeking what
might practicably be done to improve the condition of
the Jews in the Russian Empire. While it was said that
his wife was a Jewess, his interest in the Jewish question
was perhaps primarily to improve the relations between
Russia and the United States. The Russian massacres,
with the resultant enforced emigration, the public meetings
of protest in this country and the press comments, had
seriously prejudiced public opinion here against Russia.</p>

<p>The Count therefore invited a committee to confer
with him and Baron Rosen at Portsmouth. There were
Jacob H. Schiff, Isaac N. Seligman, Adolph Kraus,
Adolf Lewisohn, and myself. The Count admitted with
much frankness the condition of the Jewish population of
Russia, and that it was an injustice. He expressed his
purpose to exert his best influence to remedy the just
grievances of the oppressed Jews. We assured him that
we asked for no special privileges for our co-religionists,
but the same, and no greater, rights for them than were
accorded other Russian subjects; that the granting of
such rights would relieve Russia of the Jewish question
and of the international ill-will to which this question
naturally and rightly gave rise. Both the Count and
Baron Rosen agreed with us, but argued that it was not
practicable to grant such complete emancipation, but that
it should come about gradually. We told them, of course,
that with that premise we could not and would not agree.</p>

<p>The Count was very much impressed with our presentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the subject, and our statements were corroborated
by his own observations later when he made a
visit to the lower East Side of New York where he spoke
with a number of the Russian-Jewish immigrants. He
said that upon his return to Russia he would at once take
up the problem with a view ultimately to secure equal
rights for the Jewish subjects, that he realized the necessity
for this not only from a humanitarian standpoint,
but from the standpoint of Russia's best interests and
of her relations with the leading nations of the world,
particularly with the United States.</p>

<p>Before going to Portsmouth on Count Witte's invitation,
I conferred with Roosevelt. He wanted me in an
unofficial capacity to observe carefully the progress of
the negotiations and keep him advised. Just at that time
it looked as if the conference might break up, and before
that stage was actually reached he wanted to be notified,
for he would probably have a communication to make
to the commissioners. On arriving at Portsmouth I had
a confidential talk with Fedor Fedorovich Martens, the
great Russian international jurist, who was one of my
fellow members at the Hague Tribunal, and with whom
I had been in personal touch on several previous occasions.
He was legal adviser to the Russian delegation. I
apprised him of what I knew to be the desire of the President,
and he agreed that if a break became imminent, a
communication such as the President would send would
be likely to have the right influence, and he would see
to it that, should the necessity arise for such a message,
Roosevelt should be promptly informed. I advised the
President of my understanding with Martens, but fortunately
no rupture occurred and the terms of peace were
agreed upon.</p>

<p>In his "Autobiography" Roosevelt says, with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to these Portsmouth negotiations: "I had certainly tried
my best to be the friend not only of the Japanese people
but of the Russian people, and I believe that what I did
was for the best interests of both and of the world at
large." He refers with characteristic generosity to the
help given him at St. Petersburg by our ambassador,
George von Lengerke Meyer, who "rendered literally
invaluable aid by insisting upon himself seeing the Czar
at critical periods of the transaction, when it was no
longer possible for me to act successfully through the
representatives of the Czar, who were often at cross-purposes
with one another."</p>

<p>And when the Portsmouth Conference was over, the
President further took a deep interest in bringing about
amelioration of the condition of the Jews in Russia.
When Count Witte came to New York, Roosevelt wrote
him the following letter, of which he sent me a copy:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<span class="smcap">Oyster Bay, N.Y.</span><br />
<i>September</i> 10, 1905
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Witte</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>... In furtherance of our conversation of last evening I beg
you to consider the question of granting passports to reputable
American citizens of Jewish faith. I feel that if this could be
done it would remove the last cause of irritation between the
two nations whose historic friendship for one another I wish to
do my best to maintain. You could always refuse to give a
passport to any American citizen, Jew or Gentile, unless you
were thoroughly satisfied that no detriment would come to
Russia in granting it. But if your Government could only see
its way clear to allowing reputable American citizens of Jewish
faith, as to whose intentions they are satisfied, to come to
Russia, just as you do reputable American Christians, I feel
it would be from every standpoint most fortunate.</p>

<p>Again assuring you of my high regard, and renewing my congratulations
to you and to your country upon the peace that has
been obtained, believe me,</p>

<p class="center">
Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Early in 1906, when the Algeciras Conference regarding
Morocco was in session, and the press reported that
it was likely to break up without an agreement on account
of Germany's attitude, Carl Schurz, knowing of
my close relationship with Roosevelt, wrote to me that
the President could probably prevail upon the Powers
concerned to refer the question to the Hague Tribunal.
This letter I forwarded to Roosevelt; but although he
was ever ready to vitalize the machinery of the Hague
Tribunal, advice coming from Mr. Schurz at this time
was not regarded with favor, possibly because of their
previous differences. In his reply to me, however, the
President showed what a clear and prophetic insight he
had into Germany's attitude and purposes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Modern Germany is alert, aggressive, military and industrial.
It thinks it is a match for England and France combined in war,
and would probably be less reluctant to fight both those powers
together than they would be together to fight it. It despises
the Hague Conference and the whole Hague idea. It respects
the United States only in so far as it believes that our navy is
efficient and that if sufficiently wronged or insulted we would
fight. Now I like and respect Germany, but I am not blind to
the fact that Germany does not reciprocate the feeling. I want
us to do everything we can to stay on good terms with Germany,
but I would be a fool if I were blind to the fact that Germany
will not stay in with us if we betray weakness. As for this
particular case, when I see you next I shall tell you all that I
have done and you will see that I have been using my very best
efforts for peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>In all my relations with Roosevelt, even before I became
a member of his Cabinet, I was more and more convinced
that no consideration of political self-interest or partisan
advantage ever entered his mind in determining his attitude
or action in upholding the right or dethroning a
wrong. He resented nothing more than when some politician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
or inconsiderate person made an appeal to him for
action on the plea that it would be good politics. He was
visioned, but not visionary; and withal highly practical,
in that he understood the workings and tendencies of
human forces. Just as he would read a book by absorbing
a page at a glance, so he would instinctively appraise
his fellow men; their qualities would impress him just as
a brilliant paragraph in a book would arrest his instant
attention.</p>

<p>Roosevelt would not make an idle gesture or even imply
a threat which he did not purpose to carry into action.
He was more abused by those whom he designated as
"the interests," and better understood and trusted by the
masses, than any President in our history with the exception
of Lincoln. So it is always with real leaders, who
seek to guide rather than pander to public opinion. The
latter course appeals to weak though well-intentioned
public men; the former requires not only clear vision but
high courage, and these qualities Roosevelt possessed to
an extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>When our industries were small, a strong human tie
bound together employer and worker. Following the
expansion which began after the Civil War, our industries
resolved themselves into vast organizations and corporations,
and the relations between employer and worker
became more and more impersonal. The workers first
organized into trade unions, which presently expanded
into federated unions similar to those which a generation
before had begun to be formed in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of our industries and the impersonal
relations between employer and employed made it
apparent that social justice required that reciprocal
rights be recognized in order to bring about a better
understanding of a relationship which had already become
increasingly strained and often embittered, resulting in
serious strikes and lock-outs. One of the first organizations
to meet this need was formed in Chicago in 1894,
following the Pullman strike. It was called the Civic
Federation of Chicago and was under the leadership of
a number of prominent men of that city, directed by
Ralph M. Easley.</p>

<p>Six years later the scope of this organization was enlarged,
and in the name of the National Civic Federation
a conference was called in Chicago, in December, 1900,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and the debate centered round the proposition that in
American industries voluntary conciliation was preferable
to compulsory arbitration. At that conference a committee
was selected whose duty it was to collect information
at home and abroad regarding measures of arbitration,
and to advise with employers and workmen in this
country whenever and wherever possible.</p>

<p>In the following December, 1901, the National Civic
Federation held a conference in New York in the rooms
of the New York Board of Trade and Transportation.
I was then president of that Board and was asked to
preside at the conference. After adjourning the sessions,
we organized the industrial department of the Federation,
with a committee of twelve men representing the
public, twelve men representing employers, and twelve
men representing wage-earners. These three groups
were headed, respectively, by Grover Cleveland, Marcus
A. Hanna, and Samuel Gompers. All of their colleagues
were men of national distinction and were recognized
leaders in their fields. From this larger committee of
thirty-six, an executive committee of five was selected,
whose members were as follows: Marcus A. Hanna,
chairman; Samuel Gompers, first vice-president; I,
second vice-president; Charles A. Moore, treasurer; and
Ralph M. Easley, secretary.</p>

<p>The scope and plan of the industrial department was
to promote industrial peace in whatever way might seem
best. We planned for a large meeting in May, when two
public sessions were to be held, one at Cooper Union and
one in the rooms of the New York Chamber of Commerce.
We issued a statement of our plan and scope and
inaugurated a broad educational campaign.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our department proved itself most practical.
It actively helped settle several disputes, notably the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Albany street-car strike, the disagreement between the
National Metal Trades Association and the International
Association of Machinists, and the United States steel
strike. And it was instrumental in averting the threatened
anthracite coal strike.</p>

<p>The identical ideal that I held up in my opening address
at the meeting in January, 1901, I should hold up
to-day: namely, that industrial peace, to be permanent,
cannot rest upon force, but must rest upon justice, and
in essential industries especially, upon a high sense of
responsibility to the public by both employer and employed.
In no other country are conditions, by nature
and by principles of government, better adapted to the
equitable adjustment of the reciprocal rights, duties,
and privileges of labor and capital than in our own,
because we are a democratic people with no fixed class
distinctions to separate us. The laborer of to-day may
be the capitalist of to-morrow, and vice versa. Capital
and labor are interdependent, not opponents; and it is
on the basis of that dependency that adjustments in the
relationship between them must be made. This ideal is,
happily, more widely recognized to-day than it was when
the National Civic Federation was organized.</p>

<p>I gave considerable attention to the work of the
Federation for a number of years. As the offices were in
New York and the president and first vice-president
were both resident in other cities, the direction of the
organization between conferences largely fell upon me as
second vice-president, with the important assistance of
the secretary, Mr. Easley.</p>

<p>The Federation afforded a neutral forum where, under
the chairmanship of one of its officers, the disputants
could discuss their grievances and arrive at an understanding.
Many times the growing bitterness between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
them was checked and a strike or lock-out averted. The
fact was often borne in upon me how many of these industrial
disputes grew out of misunderstandings which
were cleared away when men assembled around a table
and frankly discussed their differences.</p>

<p>To further the work and interests of the Federation I
brought together in social relationship, at several dinners
at my home, the representatives of all three groups;
namely, the public, the wage-earner, and the employer.
One day Andrew Carnegie expressed the desire to meet
the labor leaders who had instigated the strike in the
Carnegie works which resulted in the Homestead riots.
Accordingly I arranged a dinner, to which I invited a
number of the men of the labor wing of the Federation,
as well as some others of the committee, together with
Messrs. Wighe and Schaeffer, of Pittsburgh, officers of
the Amalgamated Union, who had led the Homestead
strike.</p>

<p>Carnegie knew these leaders well, and they knew him.
He called them by their Christian names and they called
him "Andy." They said that night that they and their
colleagues in the union had always believed that that
strike and riot would never have taken place had "Andy"
been present. As a matter of fact, Carnegie's relations
with his men had always been very friendly. He was
unjustly accused of the responsibility for the Homestead
riots, which might not have occurred had he, instead of
Mr. Frick, been in charge of the employers' side. Mr.
Carnegie at the time was in Scotland.</p>

<p>Only a short while before this Carnegie dinner, Marcus
Hanna had died, and our executive committee offered to
Mr. Carnegie the presidency of the Federation, to succeed
Mr. Hanna. Mr. Carnegie was gratified and very
much touched, especially by the implied confidence on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the part of the twelve labor men of the Federation; but
on account of his advanced years he felt that he could
not give the position the attention it deserved. He was,
however, glad to become a member of the executive
committee, and as such revealed himself in a most favorable
light. Beneath his Scotch nimbleness of mind there
was a broad, tolerant, and lovable heart. He met the
laboring men, not as their superior, but as one having a
genuine brotherly interest in their welfare. It became
very evident to us all why he was so highly regarded by
his workmen, and why he had so much influence with
them: they trusted to his fairness and had a real affection
for him personally. In his Autobiography he makes
feeling reference to his connection with the Federation.</p>

<p>Marcus Hanna, who was known to the country chiefly
through his political activities, was looked upon as the
leader of a group of rich men who had won political power
by commercializing our political system; and was regarded
by many as an evil influence. But in connection
with the great industrial interests that he had built up
in Ohio and elsewhere&mdash;coal mines, iron works, shipping,
street railways&mdash;little was known of him. He had shown
great capacity as an industrial general in the management
of his men, winning their good-will by fair and
equitable treatment; and it is said he never had a strike
in the industries he administered. He was highly regarded
by the labor leaders, who had confidence in his
fairness to the wage-earners. He did not oppose, as did
so many of the employers of his time, the organization of
labor unions. On the contrary, he believed that such organizations
were necessary adequately to protect the
rights of the workers.</p>

<p>As chairman of the executive committee of the Civic
Federation, Hanna displayed this better side of his character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and his great ability as an organizer and a leader.
Here he was not the cunning politician, but the genial
head of an industry who recognized the just demands of
the wage-earners and was always generous with them in
regard to compensation and labor conditions.</p>

<p>The work we did and the experiences we encountered
as officers of the Federation, each group coming into
close contact with the others and adjusting with them
industrial differences, had a decided educational value
for us all. For myself, the study I gave during these years
to the relations between capital and labor, and my active
part in the conciliation and arbitration of labor disputes,
provided me with an intensely practical background
and preparation for the secretaryship of the
Department of Commerce and Labor, which later fell to
my lot. It was this experience and my personal acquaintance
with the representatives of capital and labor all
over the country that induced me, as head of that Department,
to organize the Council of Commerce and to plan
the Council of Labor, to both of which I shall refer more
specifically later.</p>

<p>The Board of Railway Labor Arbitration of 1912 was
perhaps the most important labor arbitration body
brought into existence up to that time. Its decisions
affected the whole Eastern district: that is, that section
of our country lying east of Chicago and East St. Louis,
and north of the Ohio River to Parkersburg, West Virginia,
and of the Potomac River to its mouth. Fifty-two
railroad lines and over thirty-one thousand engineers
were involved. The latter negotiated through the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers.</p>

<p>The representatives of the Brotherhood and the members
of the Conference Committee of Managers of the
railroads held several conferences in March, 1912, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
which the Brotherhood made certain requests. The conferences
ended with the refusal of the roads to grant these
requests or any part of them, whereupon ninety-three
per cent of the members voted for a strike. Charles P.
Neill, United States Commissioner of Labor, and Judge
Martin A. Knapp, of the United States Commerce
Court, tendered their friendly offices under the Erdman
Act, but were unable to mediate, and the contending parties
would not agree to arbitrate under the provisions
of the Erdman Act. It was then decided to submit the
dispute to a board of arbitration composed of seven members,
one to be chosen by each side, and those two to agree
on the other five within fifteen days of their own appointment.</p>

<p>The roads chose Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad, and the Brotherhood chose P.
H. Morrissey, former grand master of the Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen. At the end of fifteen days, these two
had not succeeded in agreeing upon the other five members
of the board, though they had agreed upon a list
from which the five might be chosen. A committee consisting
of Mr. Neill, Judge Knapp, and Chief Justice
White, of the Supreme Court of the United States, then
chose five names from that list, and the final personnel of
the board was as follows: Dr. Charles R. Van Hise, of
Madison, Wisconsin; Frederick N. Judson, of St. Louis;
Dr. Albert Shaw, Otto M. Eidlitz, and myself, of New
York, in addition to Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Willard.</p>

</div>

<p>On July 12th the board met and organized, electing me
as chairman. The decisions of the board were to be binding
for one year and thereafter could be terminated by either
side upon a thirty days' notice. For two weeks we held
hearings, morning and afternoon, at the Oriental Hotel,
Manhattan Beach, New York. When the hearings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
over, the board adjourned until early September, when
the work of making the awards was begun. Because of
my nomination for Governor by the Progressive Party
at the time, I found it advisable to relinquish the chairmanship
of the board to Dr. Van Hise, although I continued
my membership and active interest to the end.</p>

<p>The hearings were reported and consisted of 1250 pages
of testimony. The questions that confronted the board
were not alone whether or not the wages in a given case
should be raised, but, if it was found that the rate was
inadequate, by what margin should it be increased? It
was fairly difficult to arrive at principles of standardization
applicable to so many roads, and to fix a basis of
differentiation for the many and complicated branches
of employment. The whole subject, however, had our
most careful and painstaking consideration. We took up
the whole intricate problem of the running of railroads,
with relation to the several kinds of work performed by
the engineers, in passenger service, freight service, in
switching, and in yard work, bearing in mind always that
railways were public utilities and that the necessities and
comfort of the whole people depended upon their functioning;
and that therefore the necessity for uninterrupted
service far transcended the interests of either the
roads on the one side or the employees on the other.</p>

<p>Our decisions as finally printed made a book of one
hundred and twenty-three pages. One of our chief recommendations
was that National and State wage commissions
be created which should function in relation to labor
engaged in public utilities as the public service commissions
functioned toward capital. I quote from the report:</p>

<blockquote><p>Especially for the public utilities is it important that labor
should have a just wage, and if the existing wages are not adequate,
they should be increased. If a just increase in wages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
places the public utilities in a position that does not enable
them to secure a fair return upon capital invested and maintain
a proper reserve, they should be allowed to increase their rates
until they are in that position.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another point upon which we laid stress was the limitation
of the right to strike:</p>

<blockquote><p>While it is clear from the public point of view that a concerted
strike of railway employees for a great region would be as
intolerable as a strike of the postal clerks; on the other hand, the
position of the employees is a very natural one. They feel under
existing conditions that the power to strike is their only weapon
of defense against employers and the only means by which they
can enforce a betterment of their conditions of service. They
realize, too, that the principle of concerted action, for all the
railroads in a great section of the country, gives them a most
effective weapon, and they are naturally loath to relinquish
or impair it.</p>

<p>While this is the situation under the present conditions, and
the railway employees feel that they cannot surrender their
right to strike, the necessity would no longer exist for the exercise
of this power, if there were a wage commission which would
secure them just wages.</p>

<p>Finally, it is the belief of the Board that in the last analysis
the only solution&mdash;unless we are to rely solely upon the restraining
power of public opinion&mdash;is to qualify the principle
of free contract in the railroad service. A strike in the army or
navy is mutiny and universally punished as such. The same
principle is applied to seamen because of the public necessity
involved. A strike among postal clerks, as among the teachers
of our public schools, would be unthinkable. In all these cases,
the employment, to borrow a legal phrase, is affected with a
public use; and this of necessity qualifies the right of free concerted
action which exists in private employments.</p>

<p>However, if the principle be accepted that there are certain
classes of service thus affected with a public interest and men
who enter them are not free concertedly to quit the service,
then these men must be guarded in the matter of wages and
conditions by public protection; and this it is believed can best
be done through an interstate wage commission.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The report was signed by six members of the board,
Mr. Willard adding an explanatory statement. Mr.
Morrissey wrote a dissenting opinion. For a number of
years the findings of this board, with slight alterations,
continued to be effective in adjusting wages for the different
kinds of service among the engineers, and in
governing conditions and number of working hours of the
employees.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The President's Industrial Conference of 1919-20,
of which I was a member, was of value chiefly in that it
correlated the best ideas in practice throughout the
country with regard to the prevention and relief of industrial
unrest and the betterment in general of the relationship
between employer and employee, and that it
published suggestions based on these ideas, of which the
main points were the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The parties to the dispute may voluntarily submit their
differences for settlement to a board, known as a Regional Adjustment
Conference. This board consists of four representatives
selected by the parties, and four others in their industry
chosen by them and familiar with their problems. The board is
presided over by a trained government official, the regional
chairman, who acts as a conciliator. If a unanimous agreement
is reached, it results in a collective bargain having the same
effect as if reached by joint organization in the shop.</p>

<p>2. If the Regional Conference fails to agree unanimously,
the matter, with certain restrictions, goes, under the agreement
of submission, to the National Industrial Board, unless the
parties prefer the decision of an umpire selected by them.</p>

<p>3. The voluntary submission to a Regional Adjustment Conference
carries with it an agreement by both parties that there
shall be no interference with production pending the processes
of adjustment.</p>

<p>4. If the parties, or either of them, refuse voluntarily to submit
the dispute to the processes of the plan of adjustment, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Regional Board of Inquiry is formed by the regional chairman,
of two employers and two employees from the industry, and
not parties to the dispute. This Board has the right, under
proper safeguards, to subpoena witnesses and records, and the
duty to publish its findings as a guide to public opinion.</p>

<p>5. The National Industrial Board in Washington has general
oversight of the working of the plan.</p>

<p>6. The plan is applicable also to public utilities, but in such
cases, the government agency, having power to regulate the
service, has two representatives in the Adjustment Conference.
Provision is made for prompt report of its findings to the rate
regulating body. The Conference makes no recommendation
of a plan to cover steam railroads and other carriers, for which
legislation has recently been enacted by Congress. (Esch-Cummins
Bill.)</p>

<p>7. The plan provides machinery for prompt and fair adjustment
of wages and working conditions of government employees.
It is especially necessary for this class of employees,
who should not be permitted to strike.</p>

<p>8. The plan involves no penalties other than those imposed
by public opinion. It does not impose compulsory arbitration.
It does not deny the right to strike. It does not submit to
arbitration the policy of the "closed" or "open" shop.</p>

<p>9. The plan is national in scope and operation, yet it is
decentralized. It is different from anything in operation elsewhere.
It is based upon American experience and is designed
to meet American conditions. It employs no legal authority
except the right of inquiry. Its basic idea is stimulation to
settlement of differences by the parties in conflict, and the
enlistment of public opinion toward enforcing that method of
settlement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately nothing came of the painstaking work
of this conference beyond the publishing of its final
report of March 6, 1920.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The chairmanship of the New York Public Service
Commission did not at all appeal to me when first Governor
Whitman offered it to me. The commission as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
then existed had unfortunately lost public confidence to
a large extent, and I felt that it was not the kind of service
for which I was especially qualified. However, it was
pointed out to me that there was constant danger of
strikes on the part of the thousands of workmen engaged
in the construction of subway and elevated extensions,
and an added appeal was made to me in view of the considerable
experience I had had in adjusting labor difficulties.
And so, after declining, I was finally prevailed
upon by the Governor and the late George W. Perkins,
in December, 1915, to accept this arduous duty.</p>

<p>As soon as it became known that I had accepted the
chairmanship, the Governor received a communication
from William Henry Hodge, the distinguished engineer,
announcing his willingness to serve on the commission,
although before my selection he had refused such appointment.
The other members of the commission were:
Charles E. Hervey, William Hayward, and Traverse H.
Whitney. Messrs. Hayward and Hodge left the commission,
when we entered the war, to join the army. Mr.
Hayward was commissioned Colonel, having organized
the 15th New York, afterward the 369th United States
Infantry, a regiment of colored men who performed gallant
service in France. Mr. Hodge was commissioned
Major and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, and
gave his splendid talents to the services of his country in
building roads to the battle fronts of France. Due to his
strenuous labors over there, this gifted engineer and
exemplary patriot died shortly after the armistice.</p>

<p>The commission had charge of the building of the subways
and elevated lines then in process, as well as the
regulation of traffic and all public utilities. As the war
progressed, it became clearer that our country would
inevitably be drawn in, and therefore increasingly important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that nothing should prevent the functioning of
our public utilities. And accordingly it was not long before
my services as adjuster and arbitrator of labor difficulties
were needed. The cost of living was rapidly rising,
and there was great unrest among laborers; and the
demand for skilled and unskilled labor grew day by day.
When our country entered the war, it was highly important
for the moral effect upon our own people, as well as
to avoid giving encouragement to our enemies, that the
transportation system of our greatest metropolis should
operate without interruption. During the following year
and a half I was able to adjust a dozen or more important
labor disputes and to prevent a number of strikes. The
situation was complicated by the fact that the laborers
were not employees of the commission, but of the several
contractors to whom contracts had been awarded under
conditions of fierce competition, so that every increase in
wages materially affected their profits and in the end
caused many of them to suffer considerable loss. I had to
appeal to the patriotism of both sides, and it is a pleasure
to be able to state that in every instance the response was

<p>Before I became a member of President Roosevelt's
official family, I was in what he termed his "kitchen
cabinet." My experiences in both cabinets are among the
treasured recollections of my life.</p>

<p>We were the unofficial advisers who met round the
luncheon and dinner table and afterwards in the White
House study, where the President spoke without reserve
of his executive problems and read for our criticism
and counsel his rough drafts of congressional messages,
speeches, and notes to foreign governments.</p>

<p>Holding no portfolios of state, these "kitchen cabinet
ministers" yet gave of their best; were always prepared
to toil to any extent to be of assistance to the President.
He had the quality of vitalizing things&mdash;a situation or
condition coming within his executive ken became so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
charged with life and imagination that men wanted to
put their hands and minds to it. They served Roosevelt
as energetically and loyally as if the grave responsibilities
of state were upon their own shoulders.</p>

<p>International relations and labor arbitration were the
public activities which interested me most. The President
had appointed me a member of the permanent
board of arbitration at The Hague to succeed the late
Benjamin Harrison, and shortly thereafter in his charming
manner had designated me as a member of his
"kitchen cabinet." Thus there had commenced for me
a memorable series of conferences.</p>

<p>There is much misapprehension regarding Roosevelt's
so-called impulsiveness. This was evident to those who
had an intimate view of the man at work. He was quick.
He was a prodigious worker. He was so constituted and
so self-trained that he had to do things immediately, get
them out of the way. What people called his impulsiveness
might have been more aptly termed his preparedness.</p>

<p>I had hundreds of opportunities to observe his methods.
When he accepted an invitation to deliver an address
or write an article, he would prepare it immediately,
even if the occasion were two, three, or six months off.
He revised considerably, showed his work freely to
friends and associates for criticisms, but completed it at
the earliest opportunity. He never waited. This method
served to perfect his thought and expression on a given
subject. His promptness left him free for other things.</p>

<p>The President never seemed to be hurried, though he
always worked with a wonderful driving force. He
seemed never to waste any time. It was play or work,
and both with his whole heart.</p>

<p>His public addresses were almost invariably the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of preparation. It was seldom that he spoke extemporaneously.
The fire and animation which he imparted in
the delivery of his speeches certainly conveyed no impression
that they might have been carefully prepared
and considered at a desk in a study. The pages of his
manuscript were so small and inconspicuous that they
did not interfere with his natural gestures. The effect
was almost as if he spoke extemporaneously. The written
address, printed on sheets about 3 × 6 inches, and held
in one hand, was completely lost sight of by the audience
in those moments when Colonel Roosevelt became emphatic.
In those moments he also interspersed extemporaneous
remarks which brought out his arguments
more vividly and forcefully.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I stopped in Washington and called on President
Roosevelt, early in January of 1906, on my return from a
short vacation in the South. He took me into his private
room, where we found his personal and political friend,
James H. Sheffield, and Senator Spooner. He spoke
about the political changes in New York, the defeat of
the machine in that State, the election of Herbert Parsons
as chairman of the County Committee, and of young
Wadsworth (now United States Senator), son-in-law of
John Hay, as Speaker of the House. He took a special delight
in the election of both of these men; he had a high
regard for them personally and for what they stood. He
said he had written a letter to Parsons which he hoped
would be helpful to him.</p>

<p>The President asked me to come to lunch with him,
which was another of those delightful, informal meetings.
Besides Mrs. Roosevelt, his daughter Alice, and her
fiancé, there were William Dudley Foulke, a former colleague
of the President on the Civil Service Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and friend of mine from my college days; Robert Hitt
son of Congressman Hitt; and Lieutenant Fortesque, an
officer of the Rough Riders.</p>

<p>After luncheon, the President asked me to wait for him
in the Red Room, as he wanted to have a talk with me.
When the other guests had departed, he came back to me
and with his face beaming with geniality he said: "I don't
know whether you know it or not, but I want you to
become a member of my Cabinet. I have a very high
estimate of your character, your judgment, and your
ability, and I want you for personal reasons. There is
still a further reason: I want to show Russia and some
other countries what we think of the Jews in this country."</p>

<p>Of course I was gratified, very much gratified. I told
him I had heard from several persons that he had spoken
of this intention, but that I had meant to take no notice
of it until he should speak to me about it; that I should
certainly esteem it the very highest honor to become a
member of the Cabinet, and especially to have the privilege
of working alongside of him.</p>

<p>"I knew you would feel just that way; therefore I was
anxious to let you know of my intention as long in advance
as possible," replied the President. He said all
this in such a cordial and affectionate manner that I was
profoundly touched with this manifestation of close
friendship for me.</p>

<p>He then added that he could not see that it would do
any good, and might do harm, to make further protests or
utterances regarding the massacres in Russia under the
disorganized conditions there; and he did not want to do
anything that might sound well here and have just the
opposite effect there. He thought it would be much more
pointed evidence of our Government's interest if he put
a man like me into his Cabinet, and that such a course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
would doubtless have a greater influence than any words
with the countries in which unreasonable discrimination
and prejudice prevailed.</p>

<p>He told me that it might be July or even later before
he could carry out his purpose. He would prefer to put
me at the head of the Department of Commerce and
Labor, because of my knowledge in that field, but he
could not determine the specific position until later. But
at any rate, I was to regard my appointment to one of
the Cabinet positions as certain.</p>

<p>He asked whether I knew Senator Platt, and indicated
that it might be well for several of my friends to have a
talk with the Senator. But he quickly added that it
would make no difference to him whether it suited the
New York Senator or not, though it might perhaps be a
little more agreeable if I did not have the latter's opposition.
I preferred to feel that my selection was personal,
which it really was, and without even the semblance of
political influence; so I did not ask any of my friends to
speak to Senator Platt, nor did I think he would oppose
me.</p>

<p>My wife and the rest of my family were of course
elated at hearing the news, particularly my brother
Isidor, whose attitude toward me, his youngest brother,
was always more like that of an affectionate father than
a brother. I felt no trepidation, especially should I be
selected for the Department of Commerce and Labor.
My past training and interest in many of the subjects
that came up under that department made me conversant
with the main questions it had to administer.</p>

<p>Upon my return to New York I began to make arrangements
for severing all business connections. This
I thought wise, particularly if I became head of the
Department of Commerce and Labor. It was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
necessary step, but I wanted it never to be said that I
advocated any measure or made any decision that might
in the remotest way be of advantage to my private interests.
I spoke to Roosevelt about my intention, and
he said that while it was not essential, if I could do so it
would on the whole be advisable; that situated similarly
he would do the same thing himself. Before assuming
office, therefore, I had retired from business for good, and
I have not since that time been connected with any business
for personal profit.</p>

<p>My nomination was officially made in September, but
it was not until early December, 1906, that I received a
letter from William Loeb, Jr., the President's secretary,
notifying me that the President desired me to assume
office on December 17th. On that day, accordingly, I
appeared at 9 <span class="smcap"><small>A.M.</small></span> at the Department of Commerce and
Labor, then located in the Willard Building across the
street from the Hotel Willard on Fourteenth Street.
There I met my predecessor, Victor H. Metcalf, who had
been appointed Secretary of the Navy. Mr. Metcalf
welcomed me in a brief address and introduced me to the
twelve bureau and five division chiefs of the department.</p>

<p>The Department of Commerce and Labor was the
youngest of the nine departments of the Government, the
bill creating it having been approved by President Roosevelt
on February 14, 1903. Roosevelt had done much to
establish the department and took great pride in it. The
first Secretary of Commerce and Labor was George B.
Cortelyou, who had been secretary to the President, and
by reason of his intimate relations with the officials of the
Government was admirably equipped to organize this
department, which he did with great skill and administrative
ability. After holding the office for about a year
and a half, Secretary Cortelyou became Postmaster-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and Victor H. Metcalf, Congressman from California,
was appointed, thereby becoming the next Secretary
of the Department on July 1, 1904; I was therefore the
third.</p>

<p>The scope of the Department as constituted then was
probably the largest of the nine branches of the Government.
It was charged with the work of promoting the
commerce, mining, manufacturing, shipping, and fishery
industries of the country, as well as its transportation
facilities and its labor interests; in addition it had
jurisdiction over the entire subject of immigration. It
had twelve bureaus: corporations; manufactures; labor;
lighthouses; census; coast and geodetic survey; statistics,
including foreign commerce; steamboat inspection; immigration
and naturalization; and standards.</p>

<p>In order to coördinate the work of these various bureaus
I instituted the simple method employed by large
business administrators of having the several bureau
chiefs come together with me twice a month to discuss
and confer regarding the more important administrative
subjects. This enabled me to keep better informed and
served to make the various heads of bureaus conversant
with the whole scope of the Department, preventing overlapping
and duplication of functions. I learned that this
simple administrative method had never been made use
of before in federal departments, but thereafter it was
adopted by several of the other department heads.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Cortelyou's admirable organization of
the department, I found, almost without exception, a fine
and competent set of men in charge of its several branches.
Some of them were friends of Roosevelt, members of his
"tennis cabinet," and were thoroughly imbued with his
spirit and ideals. The assistant secretary was Lawrence
O. Murray, a capable and conscientious official. James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
R. Garfield, chief of the Bureau of Corporations, devoted
himself to the difficult task of exposing the abuses and
legal infractions of some of the great corporations, and
did it with judgment and ability, and with conspicuous
courage. Charles P. Neill, chief of the Bureau of Labor,
a laboring man in his early days, and afterwards an instructor
at Notre Dame, and professor of economics at
the Catholic University, in Washington, D.C., was eminently
qualified for his duties and had the confidence
alike of labor leaders and employers. Dr. Samuel W.
Stratton, a scientist of distinction and a fine administrator,
was then chief of the Bureau of Standards, a veritable
institution of science.</p>

<p>Fortunately, when the Department of Commerce and
Labor was organized, the civil service law applied to all
appointments excepting bureau chiefs, so that I was able
to devote my time to the duties of my office, free from
claims of patronage, which had been the bane of the older
departments of the Government before the civil service
law became so generally operative.</p>

<p>My wife had so promptly put our household in order
that in a week after our arrival, we were comfortably
installed in our Washington home, No. 2600 Sixteenth
Street, a house known as the "Venetian Palace" from
the style of its architecture. It was a new house, built by
Mrs. John B. Henderson, and well suited to our needs
and for entertaining. The social functions in Washington
I found most agreeable. During the season we either gave
a dinner or attended a dinner on an average of five evenings
a week, but these occasions were not burdensome
because they usually ended by ten-thirty o'clock.</p>

<p>According to custom, President Roosevelt at the beginning
of the season designated the date on which each
Cabinet member was to give a dinner to the President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and the date assigned to me was February 19th. It had
been usual for each host to invite to this dinner all the
other Cabinet members and their wives, which left little
opportunity to invite others. Roosevelt changed this
custom so that other friends of the host were invited
rather than one's fellow members in the Cabinet. Foreign
diplomats also were not invited, the entire purpose being
to give these occasions the character of intimate gatherings,
not large, usually from eighteen to twenty-five
guests.</p>

<p>Our dinner went pleasantly. The President was in his
usual good humor. Wines were served liberally, but it
was Roosevelt's habit to drink very little. This I had
observed on several previous occasions, both at the White
House and elsewhere. Roosevelt usually took some white
wine with apollinaris, and perhaps a glass of champagne.
For this dinner my wife had secured the additional services
of a certain colored cook in Washington, a woman
famous for preparing terrapin, which was one of Roosevelt's
favorite dishes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Tuesday and Friday mornings, beginning at eleven
o'clock, were the regular days for the meetings of the
Cabinet, then as now. The day after taking office, therefore,
I attended my first meeting, taking the chair assigned
to me. It was labeled on the back "Secretary of
Commerce and Labor, December 17, 1906."</p>

<p>The Cabinet table is oblong, the President seated at
the head, and to his right and his left the secretaries in the
order in which their departments were created&mdash;Secretary
of State first to the President's right, Secretary of the
Treasury first to the left, and so on. Being head of
the ninth and youngest Department, my seat was at
the foot of the table, opposite the President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>The meetings were informal and no minutes were taken
or other record made. After some brief preliminary talk,
in which the President often had some incident to relate
or some amusing caricature or savage attack upon himself
to exhibit, the business of the day began. The President
calls on every secretary, but in no fixed order. He
presents such matters as he may deem important, and
upon which he may want discussion and advice.</p>

<p>At this meeting I intended not to bring up anything,
preferring to wait, as the saying is, until I got "warm in
my seat." But an important matter had come up that
very morning upon which I had made a decision, based
on the carefully reasoned opinion by the solicitor of the
department, Mr. Charles Earl. The State of South
Carolina, under one of its recent laws, had authorized its
State Commissioner of Immigration to go to Europe and
select a number of skilled factory hands for the industrial
establishments of the State. There were about four hundred
and fifty of these immigrants, and there was some
question about admitting them. The Immigration Law
of 1903, as well as previous laws, excepted the State from
its contract labor clauses, and I therefore decided upon
their admission.</p>

<p>Indeed, no subject in the department occupied my
daily attention to the extent that immigration did.
Fortunately, at the chief port of entry, Ellis Island in the
New York Bay, there was a capable, conscientious,
efficient commissioner, Robert Watchorn.</p>

</div>

<p>The right of the immigrant to land, after his medical
examination, was based upon the decision of a board of
inquiry. This board often made hurried and ill-considered
decisions, especially when the immigration was
large. In the case of exclusion, the immigrant has the
right to appeal to the Secretary of the Department of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Commerce and Labor. Of course, cases coming under
certain portions of the exclusion provisions, such as contract
labor, mental deficiency, affliction with loathsome
and contagious diseases, were easily enough disposed of;
but under the provision "Likely to become a public
charge" there was room for the personal attitude of the
members of the board, and the fate of the immigrant then
depended on whether or not these men were restrictionists.
I felt that there was a domestic tragedy involved in
every one of these cases, and as the law placed the ultimate
decision upon the Secretary, I decided this responsibility
was one that should not be delegated; so day by
day I took up these decisions myself, frequently taking
the papers home with me and carefully reviewing them
before retiring.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Important among the immigration subjects were those
which presented phases of the Japanese question, the immigration
<i>en masse</i> of Japanese to the Pacific Coast States,
California in particular. The question was brought up by
Secretary Root at one of the Cabinet meetings. The city
of San Francisco had taken action excluding Japanese
from the public schools. It was deemed detrimental for
the white children of tender ages to be in the same classes
with older and even adult Japanese who came to these
schools to learn English. My predecessor, who was a
resident of California, had investigated and was conversant
with all aspects of the case.</p>

<p>The President insisted that, as it directly affected the
relations between the two nations, it was a national concern.
Several members of the Cabinet also regarded the
subject as one having serious probabilities. Secretary
Root asked me whether I could furnish some data as to
the use made of Hawaii by Japanese immigrants for circumventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
our contract labor law, as many of the Japanese
immigrants were coming to the mainland via Hawaii.
Upon looking into this question I found during the year
previous fully two thirds of the Japanese came via
Hawaii. The President took the situation in hand and
had the mayor of San Francisco and other leaders of the
Japanese agitation come to Washington.</p>

<p>The obnoxious matter was finally adjusted with Japan
in a manner to allay irritation by a "Gentlemen's Agreement,"
by which that country itself was to prevent the
emigration of its laboring classes. It was, of course, much
better that the Japanese interdict emigration of their own
people than that we offend that nation's pride by preventing
their entrance, although it was made clear that
we should pass an exclusion law if they did not take
prompt and effective action.</p>

<p>With some exceptions, this plan worked well. The
whole Japanese question, however, was still smouldering.
A few months later, during a call at the Department, the
Japanese ambassador mentioned to me that in some parts
of the Pacific Coast the Japanese were being molested
in the streets and that, of course, such things made bad
blood and stirred up the people in Japan, with which I
had to agree. I admitted that this was an outrage, stating
that I was sure our respective governments would
do all in their power to maintain good relations, to which
he replied that he did not see how those good relations
could be disturbed.</p>

<p>Ambassador Aoki then referred to the naturalization of
his countrymen in the United States. I told him that on
that question I agreed entirely with the President, who
in one of his recent speeches had dwelt emphatically on
it, advocating laws for the naturalization of Japanese the
same as accorded to other aliens. He then mentioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Executive Order of the President with reference to Japanese
immigration and the regulations for the enforcement
of it. I told him I had these regulations in hand and he
could rely upon me to make them so as to avoid every
possible friction and reflect in every way the broad and
liberal spirit of the administration; also that under the
immigration act the matter was to a large extent in
the control of Japan in issuing limited passports to the
special classes affected, namely, skilled and unskilled
labor.</p>

<p>After one of the Cabinet meetings I had a conversation
with Secretary Root and submitted to him redrafted regulations
for any suggestion or amendment that might
appear to him desirable, for I was anxious that the Secretary
of State should give the regulations critical examination,
in view of their affecting our relations with
Japan. He returned them to me within a few days with
one or two slight changes, which I adopted, and out of
them grew the "limited passports" provision of the Immigration
Act of 1907.</p>

<p>From time to time I brought up the Japanese situation
and emphasized that I regarded it in a most serious light.
Meanwhile, whenever the opportunity presented itself I
did whatever was possible to promote good-will between
the two countries. Japan's great military chief, General
Tamemoto Kuroki, paid a visit to the United States, and
was given a gala dinner at the Hotel Astor in New York,
following ovations to him all the way across the continent
from the time he landed at San Francisco. There were
over a thousand guests. Admiral Dewey was presiding
officer; John H. Finley was toastmaster, and it was felt
he was particularly chosen, being president of the College
of the City of New York, because of the protest this
would imply against the exclusion of Japanese children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
from the San Francisco public schools. I was invited to
deliver an address, in which I said:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Government and people of Japan, not unmindful of the
good-will and early friendship of our country, are too wise to
permit the San Francisco school incident, which was fostered
by ignorance and propagated by injustice, to cloud their just
appreciation of the enlightened spirit of American institutions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Captain Tanaka, of General Kuroki's staff, had handed
me in translation a message that the General had prepared
for the American people, which I read in the course of my
address. It was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Japanese people love peace. They fought for peace.
My nation wants peace in which to develop the opportunities
that are hers. We have no other desire.</p>

<p>The profession which I have the misfortune to follow is noble
only because sometimes it is necessary to establish conditions
in which peace may be maintained and in which the arts of
peace may flourish.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this I added that nobler sentiments never fell from the
lips of a conquering hero, and they would stand beside
those uttered by our hero of the Appomattox: "Let us
have peace." This was received with much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Early in June, 1907, there was another outbreak in San
Francisco against the restaurant keepers, and telegrams
from Tokyo told of the irritation this caused among the
people in Japan. At the Cabinet meeting I took the
subject up again with considerable emphasis. I pointed
out that these incidents were accumulating and were
bristling with grave consequences; that Japan had come
into the front rank among nations and could not afford
to permit us or any other nation to slap her, as it were,
in the face, or to treat her even in small things as a nation
of inferior race. I brought up the subject of Japanese naturalization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
As the law stood, a Japanese could not be
naturalized, according to the rulings of one or two judges
of the United States courts; but the subject had never
been finally decided. A short time previous to this a
Japanese seaman in Florida had filed a petition for
naturalization which was granted, and I referred the
matter to the Attorney-General to see whether that
would not afford an incident wherewith to test the law.
But no action was taken.</p>

<p>At first the President did not seem to attach to the
subject the importance that I did, but Secretary Root
immediately spoke up that he agreed with my view of it,
and as the discussion went along, the rest of the Cabinet,
as well as the President, gradually came over to my view.
At the end the President remarked: "I am very glad you
brought up that subject."</p>

<p>During the discussion I reviewed the whole legal aspect
of the matter, and referred to the fact that the several
decisions made had been based on Chinese precedents.
I also touched on the ethnological aspect, that it was
doubtful whether the Japanese could be classed as Mongolians.
This phase appealed to Roosevelt, who seemed
well informed in ethnological studies. I felt rather
gratified with this thorough discussion of the subject. It
had interested me for years, and I had been ruminating
on it for several weeks.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At the last Cabinet meeting before the vacation season,
each member referred to his plans for the summer. I had
decided to combine business with pleasure by taking a
trip along the Canadian border from Montreal to Vancouver
to inspect the lighthouse and immigration services,
then down the Pacific Coast and to Hawaii, where I
might acquaint myself with regard to immigration as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
affected the Japanese question. The President thought
this would be a useful trip and urged me to take it.</p>

<p>In the administration of a department such as that of
Commerce and Labor, it was important to familiarize
one's self as much as possible with its outlying branches,
to become personally acquainted with the various officers
and the details of their work and surroundings, thereby to
enable one better to do the administrative work than by
remaining at one's desk.</p>

<p>After leaving Vancouver we stopped a few days each
at Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco, where I conferred
with the officials of the Department. From San Francisco
we took a steamer to Hawaii, on board which we met
George R. Carter, Governor of Hawaii, returning from
a vacation in the United States, and Congressman and
Mrs. Nicholas Longworth. It made a very pleasant party.</p>

<p>The authorities and the population gave us a rousing
welcome, cannons saluted, and the militia was out to
escort us. Only once before since the island became
United States territory had a Cabinet official paid a visit,
and that was two years before when Secretary of War
Taft stopped there for a few days <i>en route</i> to Japan. We
were comfortably installed in the Hotel Moana, in the
suburb of Waikiki.</p>

<p>The islanders showered upon us bounteous hospitality
in every conceivable form. We participated in rounds of
dinners and receptions. Governor and Mrs. Carter entertained
the Longworths and us in the official residence, the
former palace of the Hawaiian rulers, in the throne room
of which hung the portraits of those rulers from earliest
times to the deposed Queen Liliuokalani. The reception
was a brilliant occasion. The leading officials and the
<i>élite</i> of the population were there; the grounds were
beautifully illuminated; and the Royal Hawaiian Band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
played the soft, plaintive music so typical of the mild
temperament of the people and the luxuriant foliage of
the island. My time was much taken up with official and
semi-official duties. The island residents impressed me
with the great need for better shipping facilities between
the mainland and the islands. The coastwise shipping
laws applying to them since annexation penalized the
carrying of passengers or freight in other than American
bottoms. Foreign ships accepting either passengers or
freight to American ports on the coast were heavily fined.
The result was, not only inconvenience to residents who
for one reason or another needed to leave the islands, but
the loss of much perishable freight, principally fruit,
which rotted on the wharves waiting for American ships.
I promised them that I would do everything in my power
to help them get the shipping facilities they needed.</p>

<p>A delegation of Japanese editors, representing the four
Japanese newspapers of Honolulu, called to ascertain
my views regarding Japanese matters in the islands,
what my policy was with regard to Japanese immigration,
and whether I believed that the preponderance of
Japanese people in Hawaii was inimical to the interests
of the territory. I answered them:</p>

<blockquote><p>An ideal condition for the future welfare of these islands
would be that there should not be too great a preponderance of
any one race, but that an equilibrium be maintained.</p>

<p>I would impress upon you, and upon each of the several races
here, to have a care not to exploit these islands and their resources
for the benefit of the country from which they come,
but to act in the spirit of loyalty to the government under
which they live; of loyalty to the interests of the islands which
afford such happy and ideal homes for them and their children.
I am gratified that the public school system has such a great
influence upon the young, who grow up with the American
ideals and respect for the liberty of the individual. I would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to see an increasing number of Americans from the mainland
come and settle in these islands, if for no other reason than to
guarantee for all time to come the continuance of the American
spirit for the benefit and welfare of all peoples who have made
and will make their homes here.</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately the time at my disposal did not permit
my visiting the various islands. We did, however, see
everything to be seen at Oahu, the island upon which
Honolulu is situated. Rear-Admiral Very took us on the
U.S.S. Iroquois to visit Pearl Harbor, the famous landlocked
bay large enough to shelter the battle fleets of
several nations. We also visited the Waialua pineapple
plantation and cannery, where twenty thousand cans of
the large, luscious fruit were put up daily. The processes
of paring, coring, slicing, and canning were done by
machinery with great speed, and we enjoyed tasting the
fruit as much as any school children might.</p>

<p>In Honolulu I met Viscount Ishii, who was then Japanese
under-Secretary of State. He has since been ambassador
at Washington and at this writing is ambassador at
Paris. We had frequent conferences and went over the
whole Japanese question. He had fully informed himself
upon all phases of the subject, as well as regarding the
idiosyncrasies of the Pacific Coast States in opposing the
immigration of Japanese laborers. Ishii's thorough understanding
of the situation at that time did much to smooth
ruffled feelings in Japan. The Viscount returned to the
States on the steamer with us.</p>

<p>As we sailed out of the harbor on the Asia, bedecked
with Hawaiian flowers, the Royal Hawaiian Band played
its farewell music. The last words we heard from the
Hawaiian shore were "Aloha Nui," the Hawaiian farewell.</p>

<p>I had satisfied myself that, so far as concerned the carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
out of the President's Executive Order of March 14,
1907, the Japanese officials in both Hawaii and Japan
were doing everything in their power. Hawaii at the
time had a population of about 160,000, in round figures,
of which about 80,000 were Japanese, 20,000 Chinese,
and 25,000 native Hawaiians. Of the white element the
biggest percentage were Portuguese, who numbered
about 22,000, while all other Caucasians together, principally
American, British, and German, numbered
14,000. It therefore behooved our officials on the islands,
in the Pacific ports, and along the Mexican border, to be
especially watchful to carry out the regulations which
the Department had formulated with regard to the admission
of Japanese or Korean skilled and unskilled labor.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Soon after my return I had a conference with the
President at Oyster Bay. The President informed me
that Secretary Taft was about to leave for Japan, to go
from there to Russia by the Siberian Railroad. He said
he had authorized him to see what could be done toward
overcoming the difficulties in our relations, and what
might be the effect in Japan if we were to endeavor to
pass a law giving naturalization to Japanese exclusive of
the laboring classes and the small traders who practically
belonged to the same class. This subject the President
had urged in his last Message to Congress.</p>

<p>On October 25th I brought up in the Cabinet meeting,
for the information of the President, statistics regarding
Japanese immigration up to October 1, 1907, which
showed that the immigration for the twelve months then
ended was almost double that of the preceding twelve
months, and also that there had been an appreciable
increase since April 1, when the President's Executive
Order went into effect, compared with the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
months. The statistics regarding the transit of Japanese
between Mexico and Canada showed that something like
six hundred and seventy registered from April to September,
but only about one third that number actually made
the transits. It was presumed, therefore, that the rest got
off within United States territory.</p>

<p>The President seemed very much annoyed with this
condition of things. I recalled to his mind that when the
regulations under his Executive Order were originally
presented by me, they contained a clause, along the lines
of the Chinese regulation on the subject, to prevent the
abuse of transit privileges, but that he and the Cabinet
had decided it to be unwise to put in that clause. A few
months thereafter, when we first suspected the abuse of
transit privileges, I directed an accurate account to be
taken of these transits, the result of which I now presented.</p>

<p>The first impulse of the President was to direct that
all transit be denied, but I pointed out that that would
raise considerable objection, as it would place the Japanese
in a special class in that respect. He insisted that
something must be done. I suggested that the problem
needed careful thought and I would take it up and prepare
regulations similar to those for the Chinese. This I
did, and the Japanese regulations differ only in that we
do not require the photographing of the person to make
the transit.</p>

<p>I did not propose to drop the matter of Japanese immigration
and naturalization. Again and again I brought
it up in Cabinet meetings. I believed the best way of
adjusting the difficulties was to try to negotiate a treaty
with Japan permitting the naturalization of Japanese
other than laboring classes, and in return excluding all
who came within the category of skilled or unskilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
labor. The belief that such a treaty could be negotiated
was confirmed by my talks with Ishii both at Honolulu
and later when he visited Washington. The right to
naturalization would be taken advantage of by only five
or six thousand and would not, of course, be granted to
the laborers then resident in the United States.</p>

<p>There were about seventy-three thousand Japanese in
the United States, and it was fair to assume that two
thirds of these were of the laboring class. Of the remainder
there was a small percentage of women and
children, and then there were those born in America.
Japanese eligible for citizenship would therefore not
exceed ten or twelve thousand, and it was reasonable to
assume that not more than half of them would be willing
to throw off their native allegiance. My belief was that
such an adjustment of the problem would leave no irritation
behind it.</p>

<p>The President did not think such a treaty would be
confirmed by the Senate, and to have it rejected would
make matters worse. Secretary Metcalf thought the
California members would not agree to such an arrangement.
Notwithstanding these objections I was of the
opinion that such force of argument could be found in
favor of the arrangement that even representatives from
California would not fail to see its advantage.</p>

<p>The whole question simmered along for a year or more,
during which our understanding with Japan in regard to
the "Gentlemen's Agreement" and the regulations under
it were put into concrete and final shape; that is, a letter
was written by the Japanese ambassador to our Secretary
of State setting forth the understanding of Japan, to
which the Secretary replied accepting that understanding
and setting forth the amicable relations existing between
the two countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>In late January, 1909, there was a recrudescence of
anti-Japanese legislation in California. There were introduced
in the State legislature three bills: (a) to exclude
Japanese from ownership of land; (b) to segregate the
Japanese in special districts of the city; (c) to prohibit
Japanese from attending the public schools. With his
usual good judgment the President telegraphed the
Governor of California saying he was writing him and
asking that he withhold any legislation affecting the
Japanese until the receipt of that letter. For the time
being this action had the desired effect.</p>

<p>The legislature of California was somewhat under the
influence of agitators, like the Japanese and Korean
Restriction League and some labor bodies. It was believed
that the general sentiment of California was
against such legislation, but either to avoid conflict, or
from indifference or lack of public spirit, such sentiment
did not make its influence felt. I had given out figures
from month to month showing the number of immigrants
from Japan as compared with previous figures. I then
made public statistics which showed that for the calendar
year 1907 the number of immigrants was 12,400, whereas
for the calendar year 1908, after the Japanese Government
had taken the matter in hand in accordance with
the "Gentlemen's Agreement," the number of immigrants
was 4400. Deducting the figure for the emigration
from that 4400 left a total increase of Japanese population
of only 185 for the year. The California agitators claimed
my figures were erroneous, and that hordes of Japanese
were surreptitiously coming from the Canadian and
Mexican borders. I gave out several interviews to the
press to the effect that the figures were absolutely correct;
that it was absurd to deny their correctness as I had
proofs in my hands; and that if the Californians still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
doubted them a committee might call on me and I should
gladly lay my proofs before them. I had sent a copy of
these figures, certified by me, to the California authorities.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Happily our relations with Japan are now more peaceful
than they have been for some time, and to a large
degree this has been accomplished by the Four Power
Treaty negotiated at the Washington Conference on the
Limitation of Armaments in December, 1921. The various
vexatious instances that I have referred to were stimulated
by German officers stationed in the Far East and
fostered by the sensational press in both Japan and our
own country. By this means these happenings were
exaggerated far beyond their significance. The Anglo-Japanese
Alliance of 1911 came into being because of the
aggression of Germany and Russia in the Far East.
After the World War, of course, this condition no longer
obtained, and as the <i>raison d'être</i> of the alliance had
therefore vanished, there was a justified feeling in America
that the continuance of the treaty was a menace to our
country. This fact was not unrecognized in Great Britain
itself. As Mr. Balfour stated at the Washington Conference,
it was necessary to "annul, merge, destroy, as it
were, this ancient and outward and unnecessary agreement,
and replace it by something new, something effective,
which should embrace all the powers concerned
in the vast area of the Pacific." By the Four Power
Treaty the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was automatically
discontinued, and Great Britain, the United States,
France, and Japan became associated in friendly partnership
as guardians of the peace in the Far East.</p>

<p>So far as concerns the relationship between our country
and Japan, the transcendent importance of this treaty
has been to supersede and overshadow all these minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
matters that before were continually menacing our good
relations. By the reservations prepared by the American
delegates, and accepted by the other powers, it is provided
that the treaty "shall not be taken to embrace
questions which according to principles of international
law lie exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of the
respective powers." Verily this treaty stands out as one
of the great achievements of the Washington Conference.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To return to immigration problems during my incumbency
as Secretary of the Department of Commerce and
Labor, a minor though nevertheless annoying matter
needing adjustment was the regulation with regard to the
head tax. After the passage of the Immigration Law of
1903 a head tax of two dollars was levied upon all alien
passengers, including even officials of foreign governments.
In 1905 Attorney-General Moody had given an
opinion to the effect that the tax applied to all alien
passengers, whether officers of foreign governments or
not. I thought this contrary to the law of nations and
to well-established diplomatic usages recognized throughout
the world.</p>

<p>As the subject also came within the province of another
department, namely, the Department of State, I naturally
brought it up at a Cabinet meeting. The President
recommended that I issue orders in accordance with my
suggestion, and Secretary Root agreed that it was an
outrage to levy such a tax upon the representatives of
foreign governments. Informally I took the matter up
with Attorney-General Bonaparte, but as the decision
against this immunity had been made by his Department
he felt himself bound by the decision of his predecessor.
He suggested that I issue the order on my own responsibility,
but I decided for the time being not to do so. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a later Cabinet meeting I again brought up the matter,
this time reading the order as I proposed it. The President
and Secretary Root, also Secretary Taft, agreed
that it should be issued, and this I did.</p>

<p>At the same time I discussed a provision of the Immigration
Act of 1906 requiring masters of all vessels
bringing in aliens, without exception, to fill out a blank
or manifest giving the age, sex, calling, nationality, race,
of each alien, and whether able to read or write, and
whether anarchist or not. These blanks then had to be
signed by the aliens. I prepared two circulars, one ordering
the discontinuance of the head tax and the other discontinuing
the filling out of these blanks so far as concerned
diplomatic or consular officials and other persons
duly accredited from foreign governments to the United
States, in service or in transit.</p>

<p>At dinner at the British ambassador's home some
weeks thereafter Lady Bryce mentioned having to sign
a blank asking whether she believed in the practice of
polygamy. Of course, she brought it up in a humorous
way, but it was apparent that she had felt humiliated at
such questioning. I told her I fully appreciated her feelings
and was happy to be able to say that that stupid
practice had been discontinued.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The subject of naturalization had occupied my attention
for years past. Under the law then existing, as well
as under older laws, a person could be naturalized not
only in the United States courts, but in any State court
having a seal. And the naturalization laws prior to the
Act of 1906 were most carelessly administered. In the
larger cities of many of the States naturalization applications
were hurried through in bunches at the direction of
some political boss. In that way many persons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
naturalized who would have been found, had time been
taken to sift the applications, not entitled to citizenship.
The effects of so careless a method I saw in Turkey, and
in my dispatches to the State Department I repeatedly
pointed out the evil.</p>

<p>Largely growing out of my presentation of the subject,
Mr. Gaillard Hunt, chief of the passport division of the
State Department, had taken it up in his thorough
manner and made a report to President McKinley, upon
which the President appointed a commission to study the
subject. The commission was renewed by President
Roosevelt. Its report, known as House Document 326,
59th Congress, 2d Session, and entitled "Citizenship of
the United States, Expatriation, and Protection Abroad,"
was the basis of the Act of 1906. This act went far in
preventing fraudulent naturalization as well as in withdrawing
protection from those who were using United
States citizenship not with the intention of becoming part
of the new country in which they had chosen to reside,
but as a means to escape their duties as subjects of the
country of their origin upon returning there to live, as
had happened so often in Turkey.</p>

<p>For the proper carrying out of this law additional
examiners were needed, and also about eleven additional
assistant district attorneys. I therefore arranged with
Attorney-General Bonaparte to appear with him before
the Appropriations Committee of the House to explain
the necessity of an appropriation to cover the enlargement
of the corps for the enforcement and administration
of the new law. During my experience abroad much
of the time of our diplomatic representatives was taken
up with questions relating to the protection of our citizens,
and often this protection was invoked by persons
who should never have been naturalized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>The exclusion and deportation of criminals and anarchists
was another phase of the immigration service to
which I had given considerable study. I found the law
provided for arrest and deportation of criminal aliens
only up to three years of the time of their landing, and
that there was gross misconception regarding the scope
of the law. There was no coöperation between our immigration
officials and the local police departments for
the detection of such persons. The police departments of
most of our cities were disposed to assume that by virtue
of the immigration law the whole subject was under the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government; and on the
other hand our officials did not confer with municipal
officials to make use of the immigration law. It is one
thing to provide for the exclusion of criminals and anarchists,
but it is quite another to discover, on entry,
whether a person belongs to either class. They are usually
neither illiterate nor lacking in cunning and deception,
but within three years they may be detected, as "birds
of a feather flock together."</p>

<p>I decided to issue a circular to all commissioners of
immigration and immigration inspectors, with a view to
bringing about coöperation with the local officials. I
took the subject up in the Cabinet and the President
approved. It so happened that while this circular was
being prepared, an Italian immigrant, recently arrived,
killed a Catholic priest in Denver while the latter was
officiating at a mass in his church, and a day or two thereafter
another recently arrived immigrant, a Russian,
attacked the chief of police of Chicago and his family
with a dagger. Both of these men would have come under
the deportation provisions of the immigration law had
the police been aware of these provisions, as in both
instances they had been suspected, by their affiliations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and their talk, of being anarchists, as that term is defined
in the Immigration Act of February 20, 1907. Under the
local criminal laws this suspicion was not enough to
justify arrest.</p>

<p>Appearing as it did immediately after these two incidents
my circular had much publicity and brought
about the deportation of a number of undesirables upon
evidence supplied by the police and detective officers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In a Department which covered so many and such
varied subjects, the conflict between human and property
interests was often apparent. I recall a remark by the
President, as we were speaking about this, that whenever
within my jurisdiction there occurred this conflict he was
sure I would lean on the human side, and I could always
count on his support.</p>

<p>A striking example of this conflict grew out of an order
I issued for the inspection of excursion and ferry boats at
least three times a year instead of once. The summer
before I took office the boiler of the General Slocum, a
large excursion boat on the Long Island Sound, blew up
and caused the death of over a hundred women and
children. As spring approached and the excursion season
drew near, I made up my mind that I should make all
possible provision to prevent the recurrence of any such
disaster.</p>

<p>I accompanied the supervising inspector-general,
George Uhler, to witness the inspection of some passenger
boats plying between Washington and Norfolk,
to get personal knowledge of the details of inspection.
I carefully studied a report made to me by Mr. Murray,
the assistant secretary of my Department, who had been
a member of the board of inquiry into the Slocum disaster
and later the Valencia wreck. I called a meeting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
board of supervising inspectors of steamboats and impressed
upon them the importance of great care in inspection.
I urged that no man be retained in the inspection
service who was not thoroughly competent and efficient,
since they had to deal with the protection of human life.</p>

<p>My order for more frequent inspection brought forth
many objections from the steamboat owners, and, as is
usual in such cases, a committee came to Washington and
presented their grievances and objections direct to the
President, in the hope of inducing him to overrule my
instructions. They were patiently heard, but their main
objection was that it would cost a little more and be a
little more inconvenient to have three inspections instead
of one, and the President gave them little more comfort
than to make it quite clear that he was thoroughly in
accord with my action for the provision of greater safety
to human life. He told them he felt he was fortunate in
having at the head of the Department of Commerce and
Labor a man who was a humanitarian besides having
large business experience, for while it was his purpose to
harmonize human and business interests, always when
they conflicted he would lean toward the human side,
as I had done in issuing that order.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The President was deeply interested always in the
natural resources of the country and their preservation,
and asked me to take up the question of the Alaska
salmon fisheries. It was certain that unless some drastic
action was taken, the salmon would be destroyed in the
Alaskan waters just as they had been in the Columbia
River. Roosevelt was familiar with the problem and
believed that Wood River ought to be closed. I devoted
parts of two days to a hearing on the subject. The cannery
interests were represented by their counsel and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Fishermen's Union by several of its officers. Senator
Fulton, of Oregon, as well as the two Alaskan delegates
in Congress, pleaded for the closing of the rivers.</p>

<p>After hearing all sides and studying the question I
signed an order directing the closing of both the Wood
and Nushagak Rivers to trap and net fishing, and if the
law had permitted, I should have directed the closing
also of Nushagak Bay, where extensive trap fishing was
carried on.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When I was president of the New York Board of Trade
and Transportation I was impressed with the importance
of establishing a closer relationship between the commercial
bodies of the country and the Government.
Shortly after I became Secretary of Commerce and
Labor, therefore, I sought to accomplish that end. I had
a study made by Nahum I. Stone, tariff expert of the
Bureau of Manufactures, of the relations between the
European governments and their commercial bodies,
especially in such countries as Great Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, and Belgium. I sent invitations to
about forty of the leading chambers of commerce, boards
of trade, and other commercial organizations throughout
the country to send delegates to Washington for a two
days' conference, with a view to bringing about an organization
of these bodies for the purpose of coöperation
between them and the departments of the Government
having to do with commerce and manufactures.</p>

<p>Accordingly on December 5th a representative gathering
of over one hundred delegates met in my Department,
and I put before them a plan for organization.
I invited Secretary Root, who took a deep interest in the
scheme, and he made a thoughtful address, in which he
impressed upon the gathering the things that ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
done, and could be done only through organization and
the power of concerted effort. Andrew D. White, our
experienced ambassador at Berlin, had sent to the President
a letter containing the proposal that a method of
instruction in commerce be applied at the instance of our
Government as had been done in agriculture; this interesting
proposal I read to the meeting.</p>

<p>I then went with the delegates in a body to the White
House where the President addressed them. In the afternoon
Gustav H. Schwab, of the New York Chamber of
Commerce, was elected temporary chairman and the
organization of the council proceeded. A committee on
organization and a committee on rules were appointed,
and it was decided that an advisory committee of fifteen
members was to have headquarters in Washington. The
number of meetings to be held per year was fixed, as well
as the annual dues. On December 5, 1907, the National
Council of Commerce came into being.</p>

<p>A year later the first annual meeting was held in my
Department. The Council now had permanent offices in
the Adams Building, with William R. Corwine in charge.
In my address to the delegates I stressed the importance
of the development of our commercial relations with the
South American republics, particularly in view of the
rapidly approaching completion of the Panama Canal.
At that time we had only twenty-three per cent of the
foreign trade of South America, and one of the main
requirements for increasing our share was the establishment
of better shipping and postal facilities. To that end
I recommended in my annual report that the Postal
Subsidy Act of 1891 be extended to include ships of sixteen
knots and over, and my colleagues, the Secretary
of State and the Attorney-General, made similar recommendations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>A month after the change of Administration the executive
committee of the Council held a meeting, again
in the Department of Commerce and Labor, at which
they passed the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Resolved, by the members of the Executive Committee of
the National Council of Commerce in meeting assembled in the
office of the Hon. Charles Nagel, the present Secretary of
Commerce and Labor, That they tender their heartiest thanks
to the Hon. Oscar S. Straus, the former Secretary of Commerce
and Labor, for his constant and well-directed efforts in forming
and promoting the National Council of Commerce, expressing
their appreciation of his far-sightedness, his patriotism, his
energy, his fairness, and his friendship, assuring him of the high
personal esteem in which he is held by all of them, and asserting
that in their judgment he has laid the foundation for a movement
which will redound not only to his credit as a Cabinet
officer, but one which will ultimately be productive of incalculable
benefit to the business interests of our country, the
development of which he has so deeply at heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later that year the Council was reorganized and called
the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, which
to-day is an important institution in the commercial life
of our country.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To bring about a similar relationship between the
Department and the labor bodies, I called another conference
in February, 1909, to which I invited the leading
labor representatives throughout the country, and
about fifty attended. Unfortunately my term of office
was drawing to an end and there was not time to organize
this wing, but I urged the men to insist upon
the continuance of the conferences and the coöperation
with the Department thus established.</p>

<p>The matters discussed at this meeting were mainly
how best to lessen unemployment, how the Division of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Information under the Bureau of Immigration might be
administered for the greater benefit of labor in general,
and how the Nobel Peace Prize, which President Roosevelt
had set aside for a foundation for the promotion of
industrial peace, could be made most effective. There
were addresses by Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor; Warren S. Stone, grand
chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; William
F. Yates, president of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial
Association; and Terence V. Powderly, chief of the
Division of Information in the Bureau of Immigration.
The presiding officer was Daniel J. Keefe, Commissioner-General
of Immigration and Naturalization.</p>

<p>During my term of office repeated efforts were made in
Congress, backed by organized labor, to divide my
Department and make two of it&mdash;the Department of
Commerce and the Department of Labor. I successfully
opposed this plan, my idea being that labor and capital
were the two arms of industry, the proper functioning of
which could best be secured by coöperation, which in
turn could best be promoted by administering their
interests together. In this I had the support of President
Roosevelt. During the Taft Administration, however, the
bill was passed creating the Department of Labor.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have mentioned Roosevelt's Nobel Peace Prize. As
received by the President, it consisted of a medal and
diploma, and a draft for $36,734.79. He decided not to
keep the money, but to turn it over in trust for a foundation
for the promotion of industrial peace. In January,
1907, he called me to the White House and told me that
he would forward the draft and the papers to Chief
Justice Fuller, with the request that he communicate with
the other trustees, of whom there were four: James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture; John Mitchell, president
of the Anthracite Coal Operators; ex-Mayor Seth
Low, of New York, and myself.</p>

<p>Later the Chief Justice came to my Department with
the papers to go over them with me and to arrange for
their safe-keeping until we could have a meeting and
formulate a plan of action. Subsequently he informed me
that before preparing the draft of the act granting the
foundation it was necessary to write a preamble setting
forth its objects and purposes, and this he found it difficult
to do. I relieved his mind by offering to prepare the
bill with the preamble. I consulted with Dr. Cyrus Adler,
of the Smithsonian Institution, who had had considerable
experience in drafting documents for the creation of
trusts of this nature. With his assistance I prepared the
draft of the preamble and the bill, which the Chief Justice
approved. I then took them to the President, who also
approved them and requested me to call a meeting of the
trustees, of whom there were to be nine instead of five as
originally.</p>

<p>At the meeting of January 27, 1907, a few slight
changes were made and adopted in the bill. Thus redrafted,
with a report attached giving a history of the
award, it was introduced in the House by Congressman
Richard Bartholdt, of Missouri, member of the Committee
on Labor; and in the Senate by John W. Daniel,
of Virginia. It was promptly passed. The board of
trustees as finally constituted included: Archbishop
Ireland, Samuel Gompers, Daniel J. Keefe, Seth Low,
Marcus M. Marks, Dr. Neill, Warren S. Stone, James
Wilson, and myself.</p>

<p>The foundation was in existence for about ten years,
and in that time the interest on the money merely accumulated,
because the trustees were unable to find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
proper means for employing it. In July, 1917, Mr. Roosevelt
requested Congress to repeal the bill and return the
money to him, that he might distribute it among the
different charitable societies in the United States and in
Europe which were affording relief to the sufferers from
the war. The request was granted, and the sum with its
accrued interest, amounting to $45,482.83, was thus
distributed by him.</p>

<p>Roosevelt always encouraged the members of his
Cabinet to make speeches in various parts of the country
on subjects uppermost in the mind of the public, with due
regard, of course, to the duties of office. I accepted a
number of the many such invitations that came to me.
At the banquet of the National Association of Manufacturers,
held in the Waldorf Hotel, New York, in May,
1907, I was asked to be the principal speaker. I made
careful preparation of an address, part of which I devoted
to advocating a moderate tariff reform, with a view to
providing a maximum and minimum tariff to meet discrimination
against us by some European nations. I
consulted with the President about it. While he agreed
with my premises, he thought the time not ripe to project
that issue, so I redrafted my speech and devoted it to
such topics as the development of our manufactures, the
work of the Bureau of Corporations, and the relations of
employers and workers.</p>

<p>On April 3, 1908, the Savannah Board of Trade celebrated
its twenty-fifth anniversary, and I was asked to
be one of the speakers. Two others were Governor Hoke
Smith and Representative J. Hampton Moore, president
of the Atlantic Deep Waterways Commission. It was
a special occasion and was widely advertised for several
weeks. I prepared an address in which I outlined
also some of the activities carried on by my Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
for the benefit of the commercial interests of the
country. On this trip my wife and younger daughter
accompanied me. During our stay at Savannah we were
the guests of the Board of Trade, who showed us every
possible attention, in true Southern fashion, and we
thoroughly enjoyed our stay.</p>

<p>The Mayor and prominent citizens of my former home,
Columbus, upon learning of our presence in the South,
sent us a pressing invitation to visit that city. A committee
met us at the station, and in the evening a dinner
was given at the Opera House, at which about a hundred
of the leading citizens were present. The dinner was
served on the stage, and while the toasts were being
responded to, the curtain was raised, disclosing an auditorium
crowded with people. I was quite touched by
this fine attention by the citizens of my former home, who
took great pride in the fact that one of their former
townsmen was a member of the Cabinet. In the audience
were several of my schoolboy friends and those of my
brothers, and I found several friends and companions of
my parents still among the living.</p>

<p>In the South at that time it was still rare for a person
to change his politics, and one of the questions that was
put to me was why had I, a member of a Democratic
family, once a Democrat myself, and even having held
office under a Democratic President, changed over to the
Republican side. In other words, why had I been on both
sides of the political fence, though they were too polite to
ask the question in that direct form. I told them that
perhaps no one had a better right than they to ask the
reason for my political affiliations. It was true, I said,
that I had been, as it were, on both sides of the fence, but
that was not my fault; the fence had been moved. This
produced great merriment and applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>Talbotton, the first American home of my family, also
extended an invitation to us, which I accepted with
pleasure. A dinner and reception were given in my honor
at the public hall known as the Opera House, at which
the Mayor of the town made an address, as well as several
other prominent citizens. While in Talbotton we were
the guests of the Honorable Henry Persons, former
member of Congress and an old friend of our family. He
gave me my first rubber ball, when I was six years old.
I visited all the scenes of my boyhood; it was forty-five
years since I had lived there. The population of the town
was about the same, equally divided between the whites
and the blacks. The little Baptist church where I went
to Sunday school was much smaller than it had loomed
up in my imagination. Collinsworth Institute was abandoned,
and only the recitation hall was left standing. The
several houses wherein my family had lived brought back
vivid memories of the toils and pleasures of my parents.
The little frame cottage with the green blinds especially
impressed upon me how little is required for happiness
where there is the love and contentment which always
blessed our family. All who remembered my father and
mother spoke of them in the highest terms. I met a
number of my boyhood friends, grown gray and old. On
the whole the little town had not changed much, though
it had fewer signs of prosperity. Before the Civil War
it was the center of a rich slave-holding county. The
people, however, seemed contented and happy.</p>

<p>From Talbotton we went to Atlanta, and then made
one or two more stops on the way home. At each place we
met friends of former years and were given a thoroughly
royal welcome. In fact, the reception given us throughout
the whole tour was in the nature of an ovation.
Wherever we stopped our rooms were decorated with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
abundance of the most beautiful flowers. The Southerners
have ever been known for their hospitality, and in
this respect the New South has lost nothing.</p>

<p>Later in the year the Southern Commercial Congress,
representing ten States, assembled in Washington, and I
was asked to preside at the opening session in the large
ballroom of the New Willard Hotel. There were three or
four hundred people present. I devoted my address to a
comparison between the old agricultural South and the
new industrial South, pointing out that as the economic
interests of the South were no longer sectional but national,
it must follow that politically there is no longer a
reason for "the solid South."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On leaving the Cabinet one day at about this time the
President's youngest son, Quentin, came up to me. I had
a great affection for this bright, attractive boy. He was
eleven years old, and he informed me he weighed one
hundred and fourteen pounds. He was full of animal
spirits, frank, charming. "You gave my brother Kermit
some coins," he said to me.</p>

<p>"Yes; are you interested in them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am making a little collection," was his answer.</p>

<p>I invited him into my carriage and to come to lunch
with me. He accepted readily, and I reminded him that
he had better let his mother know. He did so by hurriedly
running into the White House and returning in
a very few minutes saying his mother said he might go.
He behaved like a perfect little gentleman and showed
that under his sparkling vivacity there was serious, intelligent
hunger for knowledge. After lunch I took him into
my library and showed him my collection of Greek and
Roman coins. I told him he might pick out what he
liked. To the several he chose I added a gold stater of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Philip. He was overjoyed. From that time onward we
became still greater friends, and he came to see me whenever
he got a new coin for his collection.</p>

<p>In 1909, when I was going through Paris, I met him
there with his mother. During this visit he and I were
quite steadily together. We visited the museums and
other places of interest. I found him a most sympathetic
and delightful companion, notwithstanding the immense
difference in our ages. What a record of glory and patriotism
this lovable boy has left to his country! And with
what fortitude his parents bore their most painful loss!
Their example strengthened the anguished hearts of
many patriotic fathers and mothers of the land who suffered
like affliction.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On Christmas Day Mrs. Straus and I received an
invitation by telephone to come to the White House
between three and four o'clock to see the Christmas tree.
Some thirty or forty guests were there, mainly friends of
the family. In one of the side rooms in the basement of the
house was assembled a large company of children. The
room was darkened, that the lighted tree might stand
out. There were presents for all the children, and Mrs.
Roosevelt played Lady Bountiful to see that each child
got its gift. Upstairs in the Red Room the gentlemen sat
smoking. It was a genuinely joyful and memorable day.</p>

<p>The social season in Washington is usually begun with
the President's New Year's reception, which lasts from
eleven o'clock until half-past two on New Year's Day.
At a few minutes before eleven o'clock the officials and
their wives assembled upstairs, and promptly at eleven
the President and Mrs. Roosevelt led the march to the
Blue Room. The procession advanced toward the main
stairway, where the line divided, the ladies going to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
left and the gentlemen to the right, reuniting at the first
landing; then through the main hall where the passageway
was roped off through a crowd of specially invited guests.</p>

<p>The order following the President was: the Cabinet
officers; the doyen of the diplomatic corps, the Italian
ambassador and his staff; the ambassadors and ministers
of the other nations, according to rank. After them,
grouped in more or less regular order, the justices of the
Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice; Senators;
Representatives; Army and Navy officials; the officers
of the Government.</p>

<p>On New Year's Day every one is accorded the right to
pay his or her respects to the President. The officials
come straight to the White House and the uninvited
guests form a line on the grounds. On the particular day
of which I speak the line stretched through the grounds,
along Pennsylvania Avenue and down by the State Department
Building, probably more than half a mile long,
and the President received about sixty-five hundred
people in all. At two o'clock the iron gates of the White
House grounds were closed, and those who had not
reached that point by that time were barred out. The
reception had to end promptly, as the Cabinet ladies who
assisted had to be present at the receptions at their own
homes from half-past two until six, in accordance with a
custom that has been in vogue probably since the days of
Washington. Our buffet in the dining-room was kept
well replenished, and there were champagne and punch
served. We had in all about four hundred guests.</p>

<p>The official functions at the White House during the
Roosevelt Administration were agreeable and in stately
form. They were usually followed by an informal supper
to which were invited personal friends and visitors.</p>

<span class="caption">MRS. OSCAR S. STRAUS</span>
</div>

<p>Our series of official dinners began with the one to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Vice-President and Mrs. Fairbanks and ended with the
dinner to the President and Mrs. Roosevelt. In addition
we followed the pleasant custom of the President and had
guests to informal luncheons three or four times a week.
These luncheons we gave in the sun parlor back of our
dining-room, which was one of the attractive features of
our Venetian palace.</p>

<p>It was my privilege to give the last Cabinet dinner to
the President, on March 2d, two days before the close of
the Administration. The event had been postponed for a
week on account of the death of the President's nephew,
Stewart Robinson, whose mother was the President's
sister. Governor and Mrs. Hughes, who were among our
invited guests, stayed over when it was found that the
dinner had to be postponed. Mrs. Roosevelt later informed
me that she planned that our dinner be the last,
knowing that I had some sentiment about it which she
and the President shared.</p>

<p>I have made several references to the wonderfully
human touch characteristic of Roosevelt. On February
5th, the day beginning the last month of his Administration,
a messenger from the White House brought me a
package containing a large folio, a handsomely illustrated
memorial volume describing the Castle of Wartburg in
Saxony, in which Luther was confined and where he
worked on his translation of the Bible. The book had been
prepared by official direction, and Roosevelt had received
two copies of the royal edition, one from the Kaiser personally
and one from the Chancellor, which latter he sent
to me with this inscription:</p>

<p>"To Mr. and Mrs. Oscar S. Straus, in memory of our
days together in the Administration; days which I have
so much enjoyed and appreciated. Theodore Roosevelt.
February 5, 1909."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE TAFT CAMPAIGN OF 1908</h3>

<blockquote><p>Roosevelt favors Taft to succeed him&mdash;I visit Taft at Cincinnati&mdash;Roosevelt
plans for his African trip&mdash;I take part in the Taft campaign&mdash;Roosevelt's
method of preparedness&mdash;Election evening at the White House&mdash;Roosevelt
rebukes a bigot; his letter on religious liberty&mdash;Taft tells Roosevelt he will
retain Wright, Garfield, and me in his Cabinet&mdash;Roosevelt's speech at the
dinner to Vice-President-elect Sherman&mdash;Looking toward the end of my term;
the last Cabinet meeting&mdash;Closing the administration of Roosevelt and ushering
in that of Taft.</p></blockquote>


<p>Early in September, 1907, in a conversation with Roosevelt
at Oyster Bay, we touched on matters political and
the forthcoming national convention of the Republican
Party for the nomination of a President. Roosevelt had
again publicly made the statement he gave out at the
time of his election, that he would not accept a renomination,
and had made known his desire that the party
nominate Taft.</p>

<p>I had just returned from Hawaii, and told him that
throughout my trip to and from the Pacific Coast I observed
an almost universal determination to force the
nomination upon him. I had met many people and addressed
several merchants' organizations and other
bodies, and again and again the sentiment of prominent
Republicans was: "We know Roosevelt is sincere in his
statement that he would decline the nomination, but
what can he do if he is renominated? He is a patriotic
man, and how can he refuse to obey the unanimous wish
of his party and the people at large?" The President
knew of this strong sentiment for him, and that was one
of the main reasons why he made the public and definite
statement that he favored the nomination of Taft, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
he regarded as best qualified to carry forward the measures
and policies of his Administration.</p>

<p>Some of Roosevelt's closest friends counseled him not
in any way to interfere with the selection of his successor.
He practically agreed to that, but in order to escape the
nomination himself he felt compelled to throw his influence
toward Taft. I think it was Secretary Root at the
time who remarked that it would be impossible for
Roosevelt to let the tail of the tiger go without some such
plan. Notwithstanding his positive statements that he
would not accept a renomination at the end of his term,
and his constant reiteration of this determination, the
pressure throughout the country was overwhelming.</p>

<p>The people naturally resent the selection of a candidate
for them by the President in office, and in the past have
shown their resentment by the defeat of such candidates.
But the conditions surrounding the Taft campaign were
somewhat different. Roosevelt was committed heart and
soul to the moral principles for which his Administration
had stood in face of the mighty opposition of the "interests."
How the force and might of this opposition had
grown until Roosevelt took up the "big stick" can perhaps
hardly be measured except by those who were with
him in the bitter fight. No one was more conversant with
the principles and policies of the Administration than
Taft, and, all things considered, perhaps none better
qualified than he to carry them forward in a firm and
constructive way.</p>

<p>The logic of the situation was, of course, that Roosevelt
stand again for the Presidency, especially as that would
not in reality have been a third term. But he would not
under any circumstances recede from the decision announced
on the night of his election. It required great
firmness not to be swept off his feet by the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
pressure to induce him to consent to be renominated.
In the face of these facts the people were less inclined
to resent his indicating his preference for the successor
whom he regarded as best qualified to carry forward the
policies he had inaugurated by such reforms as the rebate
law against railroads, the anti-trust laws, and child labor
legislation, and other progressive measures.</p>

<p>At the Cabinet meeting just before the summer vacation
Taft came in radiantly happy. He had been nominated
the day before; it had been understood for some
time that he would be nominated on the first ballot.
Reflecting at the time upon the qualifications of Mr.
Taft as a successor to Roosevelt, I put down among my
random notes that I thought he possessed the very qualifications
for constructively carrying forward the principles
Roosevelt had stood for, and which only Roosevelt
could have so courageously vitalized. Taft always
appeared to be jovial and kept, at least outwardly, a
genially good-natured equilibrium. He possessed to a
marked degree a fund of spontaneous laughter&mdash;a valuable
asset in the armor of a public man. The power to
create a good laugh has at times not only the elements
of argument, but of avoiding argument; with it a man
can either accede to a proposition or avoid acceding; it
can be committal or non-committal; it conceals as well
as expresses feelings, and acts as a wonderful charm in
avoiding sharp and rugged corners, in postponing issues
and getting time for reflection. In the practice of the law
I was once associated with a very able man who had the
ability to laugh his opponent out of court. And his was
a jeering laugh where Taft's laugh was contagious and
good-natured. Not that he lacked the ability at times to
be fearless and outspoken; he had shown himself to be
that in a number of speeches prior to his nomination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>Withal I could not help feeling sad that Roosevelt's
plan had so well succeeded, and in an intimate chat with
the President after the Cabinet meeting I told him so. He
would not have been human if, amid the satisfaction he
felt in having his choice for the Presidency respected,
there was not some feeling of regret in stepping down
from the greatest office in the world, which he had administered
with so much satisfaction and success, and the
duties and responsibilities of which he had enjoyed more
than perhaps any one of his predecessors. To use his own
words as I so frequently heard them: "I have had a bully
time and enjoyed every hour of my Presidency." Another
four years in office would doubtless have prolonged
that enjoyment.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Early in September I went to Cincinnati to meet Taft
at his headquarters in the Hotel Sinton, and Terence V.
Powderly, head of the Information Division of the
Bureau of Immigration, formerly president of the Knights
of Labor, accompanied me. I brought to Taft's attention
some correspondence that had been conducted by Louis
Marshall, of New York, with Charles P. Taft, his brother,
and with the candidate for Vice-President on his ticket,
Sherman, regarding some narrow and prejudiced editorials
on Russian immigration appearing in the Cincinnati
"Times-Star," owned by Charles P. Taft. I pointed out
that not only were these editorials untrue and unjust, but
they did not reflect his policy and yet were so interpreted.
Secretary Taft then asked the editor of the paper, Mr.
Joseph Garretson, and his nephew, Hulbert Taft, to call
on me. With them I went over the whole subject, and
upon my return to Washington young Mr. Taft sent me a
double-column article from the front page of the "Times-Star,"
together with a double-column editorial, forcefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and clearly written, embracing the whole matter as
we had covered it during my visit to Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Samuel Gompers had come out strongly in favor of
Bryan, and no one could tell what effect that might have
on the great labor element of the country. Mr. Powderly,
who was very broad-minded and independent in his
politics, said it would have little if any effect on the labor
vote, as it is not a group vote, and no leader, however
powerful, can make it so. This statement later proved
to be entirely correct. The Democrats among the labor
men went their way, and the Republicans went theirs.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Cabinet met again after the summer vacation on
September 25th. The President wanted to talk with me
afterward about several matters, so I waited and sat with
him while he was being shaved. He spoke about the
arrangements he had made for his African trip, and said
several taxidermists of the Smithsonian Institution were
to accompany him. I told him that Dr. Adler of the
Institution had spoken to me of the matter, and my
particular concern was that one of the men in his party
on this African expedition should be a physician. He
assented, saying that after all he was fifty years old and
ought to be more careful about his health than when he
was younger. He seemed to know that I had had something
to do with enabling the Smithsonian Institution to
supply these men, but I did not let it appear that I knew
much about it. When his book "African Game Trails"
appeared he sent me a copy with the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
To Oscar Straus<br />
from his friend<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theodore Roosevelt</span><br />
<br />
Nov. 1<sup>st</sup> 1910.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p>

<p>In the Appendix he makes acknowledgment to several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of his friends including myself, "to all of whom lovers
of natural history are therefore deeply indebted."</p>

<p>He mentioned that he had had an invitation to give a
lecture at Oxford University upon his return, which he
felt like accepting because it was a course in which some
of the most prominent men of the past, including Gladstone,
had lectured, and it appealed to him to speak at
this ancient university. I encouraged him to do so. He
said he did not intend, however, to accept invitations to
other European countries, because he did not wish to be
fêted. This lecture would be more in line with his work.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At the request of Roosevelt and the urgent solicitation
of Taft, I took an active part in the campaign, making
scores of speeches in the leading cities of the East and
Middle West. I made the first on September 26th, the
day after the first Cabinet meeting of the season, under
the auspices of the Interstate Republican League, in
Washington. It was one of the largest political meetings
ever held there. I addressed myself to a recent speech by
ex-Secretary of State Olney, in which he had endorsed
Bryan. I pointed out how much more had been done
under the Roosevelt Administration than by the Democratic
Administration with which Mr. Olney was connected,
in bringing suits against the trusts under the
Sherman law; that in Mr. Olney's time nearly all such
suits were brought against labor combinations, while in
Roosevelt's time they were brought against the offending
corporations.</p>

<p>I had been in close touch with Roosevelt during his
own campaign four years before, but I must say he threw
himself with greater energy into Taft's campaign, watching
every phase of it with great care and circumspection
to counteract every unfavorable tendency and to push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
promptly every tactical advantage. On Sunday afternoon,
September 27th, I received a telephone message to
come to the White House. When I arrived I found present
Secretaries Cortelyou and Meyer, Lawrence F.
Abbott, of "The Outlook," and William Loeb. Roosevelt
was dictating a letter to Bryan, in answer to the latter's
attack upon the Administration's policies, and invited
each of us to make suggestions. Those that seemed good
he immediately incorporated. I had brought with me
some facts and figures that I prepared for campaign use,
and all of this material he embodied. When the dictation
was finished, he asked us to return at nine o'clock in the
evening to go over the finished product, as it was important
that the letter be given to the press for next morning's
papers.</p>

<p>When we arrived in the evening, the President was
already at his desk correcting the typewritten pages, of
which there were about twenty. The duplicates were
handed to us, and we passed them from one to another
for reading and suggestions. At one point I suggested
changing an expression to a more dignified form, which
the President vetoed with the characteristic remark:
"You must remember this letter is not an etching, but
a poster." That was an apt illustration of his purpose,
namely, to attract and fix popular attention; and I withdrew
my suggestion.</p>

<p>The published letter occupied three and a half newspaper
columns. It was powerful and effective and nailed
some of the main fallacies that Bryan had been expounding.
This was the third such letter by Roosevelt, and
some people were inclined to criticize them as having the
appearance of overshadowing Taft and other campaign
orators. This might have been true to an extent, but it
was of little consequence in comparison with the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
effect of the letters in enlightening the people with
regard to the greater national principles for which Taft
stood.</p>

<p>The following week I started on a campaign tour. I
made speeches at Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland,
Chicago. In accepting the pressing invitation of the
National Republican Committee to make a series of
speeches, I made one condition, which was that I would
not speak at any meeting gotten up on sectarian or
hyphenated political lines. It was, and I regret to say
still is, customary, in political campaigns, especially
among local managers in smaller cities with large foreign-born
populations, to appeal to their former national sympathies.
I regarded this method as un-American and inimical
to the solidarity of our Americanism. My letter to
the chairman of the speakers' bureau, Senator Joseph M.
Dixon, was by him given to the press and widely published.
It had a very good effect, and through that campaign
at least put an end to advertising and meetings
based on race or creed appeal. Upon my return to New
York I spoke at a number of meetings in Brooklyn and
New York with Mr. Taft, the last and largest of these
being the one at Madison Square Garden, at which
General Horace Porter presided. Charles E. Hughes,
who was candidate for Governor, also spoke on that
occasion.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The President and Mrs. Roosevelt invited Mrs. Straus
and me to return to Washington with them in their
private car on election day, after we had voted in our
respective districts. <i>En route</i> the President again mentioned
the arrangements for his African trip and told me
he had also accepted an invitation to speak at the Sorbonne,
Paris. He was already preparing his Oxford address,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the draft of which when ready he wanted me to
read. It is generally believed that Roosevelt did things
hurriedly and impulsively. But those of us who were
acquainted with his methods knew the contrary to be
true. Preparedness was one of his outstanding characteristics.
He was a most industrious worker, and as
soon as he made up his mind to do something, whether it
was to deliver an address or to bring forward some reform,
he set to work at once making preparations, so as not to
leave it until the time for the event was at hand. In the
case of his Oxford and Sorbonne addresses, for instance,
he prepared them long in advance and gave himself plenty
of time to correct and polish them. He told me he pursued
this method because it freed his mind and enabled him
to be ready for the next thing to come before him. That
is certainly not the way an impulsive man works.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Election evening in Washington we were invited to the
White House to receive the returns. The twenty-five or
thirty other officials who were in the city were also there
with their wives. The returns began to come in shortly
after eight o'clock and were being tabulated by Secretary
Loeb and his assistants. It was soon evident that Taft
was elected, so that by eleven-thirty we were able to send
congratulations to the successful candidate and Frank H.
Hitchcock, chairman of the National Committee.</p>

<p>The greatest strength of Taft proved to be what many
supposed would be his weakness, namely, that he was the
choice of Roosevelt and stood for his principles. The
masses had understood the President and appreciated his
policies, though the big interests, the "ledger patriots,"
had been too blinded by their selfish objects to recognize
the permanent value of the principles and policies of
America's greatest reformer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>I felt convinced then, as I do now, that the Roosevelt
Administration will go down in history as marking the
beginning of a new era in our history&mdash;an era marking
the end of aggression upon our political structure by corporate
greed and the beginning of larger opportunities
for the individual, in which the moral principles of our
public life were rescued from the danger of domination by
an unprecedented onrush of commercial power.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At the first Cabinet meeting after the election Roosevelt
was buoyant as usual. He made a few preliminary
remarks about the approaching end of the Administration:
he and his Cabinet, especially the last one, had
worked in perfect harmony, and he felt sure we had all
had a "bully" time of it; he would retire at the end of his
term without any regrets, for he had the satisfaction of
knowing that he and his Cabinet had done all in their
power for the greatest good of the Nation. I think it is
safe to say we all felt a little sad, I know I did, to think
that in four months we should separate, and that we
should lose the inspiring companionship and guidance of
our leader, to whom each of us felt tied by bonds of warm
friendship and a sense of profound esteem and highest
respect, personally as well as officially.</p>

<p>It seemed to me then that it required no prophet's
vision to see that, if Roosevelt kept his health, in four or
eight years the people of the country would again demand,
with unmistakable and overwhelming voice, that
he become President. At the end of eight years, even, he
would be only fifty-eight, younger than most Presidents
at the time of assuming office.</p>

<p>The President now brought up a question that he had
been carrying over from the campaign period. He had
received several letters regarding the religion of Mr. Taft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Some orthodox ministerial organizations had endeavored
to use the fact that Mr. Taft was a Unitarian as a reason
for prejudicing people against him. Roosevelt had been
tempted to answer these letters, but when he presented
the matter to the Cabinet it was the general consensus of
opinion that he should not do so, that the issue intimately
concerned Taft, and information regarding it
had better be given out or withheld at Taft's discretion.
To this the President agreed, but he was incensed at this
un-American attempt to bring religion into politics,
especially as Taft was every bit as good a Christian as
Washington, and a better one than either Jefferson or
Franklin; and his church was the same as that of Adams
and Webster.</p>

<p>The election being over, Roosevelt was still desirous of
expressing his views in this matter, and he brought with
him to the Cabinet meeting the draft of a letter to be sent
to one J. C. Martin, of Dayton, Ohio, who had asked for
a public statement concerning the faith of Mr. Taft. As
usual, he invited criticism and discussion. Several of us
made suggestions, and Secretary Root made one which
the President asked him to write out so that he might incorporate
it. When the corrected version of the letter was
read, we all agreed that it was a remarkable document for
effectively rebuking the spirit of bigotry and upholding
the basic principles of the American Government, and
that it should therefore be published. It appeared in the
papers of the country three days later.</p>

<p>I made bold to ask the President for the draft of this
letter, which he gladly signed and gave to me, and Secretary
Root also signed his penciled insert. As I consider
this document worthy of a permanent place among
American annals, I herewith set it forth from the original
in my possession:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">The White House</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>November</i> 4, 1908
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I have received your letter running in part as follows:</p>

<p>"While it is claimed almost universally that religion should
not enter into politics, yet there is no denying that it does, and
the mass of the voters that are not Catholics will not support
a man for any office, especially for President of the United
States, who is a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>"Since Taft has been nominated for President by the Republican
party, it is being circulated and is constantly urged as
a reason for not voting for Taft that he is an infidel (Unitarian)
and his wife and brother Roman Catholics.... If his feelings
are in sympathy with the Roman Catholic church on account
of his wife and brother being Catholics, that would be objectionable
to a sufficient number of voters to defeat him. On the
other hand if he is an infidel, that would be sure to mean defeat....
I am writing this letter for the sole purpose of giving Mr.
Taft an opportunity to let the world know what his religious
belief is."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I received many such letters as yours during the campaign,
expressing dissatisfaction with Mr. Taft on religious grounds;
some of them on the ground that he was a Unitarian, and others
on the ground that he was suspected to be in sympathy with
Catholics. I did not answer any of these letters during the
campaign because I regarded it as an outrage even to agitate
such a question as a man's religious convictions, with the purpose
of influencing a political election. But now that the campaign
is over, when there is opportunity for men calmly to
consider whither such propositions as those you make in your
letter would lead, I wish to invite them to consider them, and I
have selected your letter to answer because you advance both
the objections commonly urged against Mr. Taft, namely:
that he is a Unitarian, and also that he is suspected of improper
sympathy with the Catholics.</p>

<p>You ask that Mr. Taft shall "let the world know what his
religious belief is." This is purely his own private concern; it is
a matter between him and his Maker, a matter for his own
conscience; and to require it to be made public under penalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of political discrimination is to negative the first principles of
our Government, which guarantee complete religious liberty,
and the right to each man to act in religious [affairs] as his own
conscience dictates. Mr. Taft never asked my advice in the
matter, but if he had asked it, I should have emphatically
advised him against thus stating publicly his religious belief.
The demand for a statement of a candidate's religious belief
can have no meaning except that there may be discrimination
for or against him because of that belief. Discrimination
against the holder of one faith means retaliatory discrimination
against men of other faiths. The inevitable result of entering
upon such a practice would be an abandonment of our real
freedom of conscience and a reversion to the dreadful conditions
of religious dissensions which in so many lands have
proved fatal to true liberty, to true religion, and to all advance
in civilization.</p>

<p>To discriminate against a thoroly upright citizen because he
belongs to some particular church, or because, like Abraham
Lincoln, he has not avowed his allegiance to any church, is
an outrage against that liberty of conscience which is one of
the foundations of American life. You are entitled to know
whether a man seeking your suffrages is a man of clean and upright
life, honorable in all his dealings with his fellows, and fit
by qualification and purpose to do well in the great office for
which he is a candidate; but you are not entitled to know matters
which lie purely between himself and his Maker. If it is
proper or legitimate to oppose a man for being a Unitarian,
as was John Quincy Adams, for instance, as is the Rev. Edward
Everett Hale, at the present moment Chaplain of the Senate,
and an American of whose life all good Americans are proud&mdash;then
it would be equally proper to support or oppose a man
because of his views on justification by faith, or the method of
administering the sacrament, or the gospel of salvation by
works. If you once enter on such a career there is absolutely no
limit at which you can legitimately stop.</p>

<p>So much for your objections to Mr. Taft because he is a
Unitarian. Now, for your objections to him because you think
his wife and brother to be Roman Catholics. As it happens
they are not; but if they were, or if he were a Roman Catholic
himself, it ought not to affect in the slightest degree any man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
supporting him for the position of President. You say that
"the mass of the voters that are not Catholics will not support
a man for any office, especially for President of the United
States, who is a Roman Catholic." I believe that when you say
this you foully slander your fellow countrymen. I do not for
one moment believe that the mass of our fellow citizens or
that any considerable number of our fellow citizens can be influenced
by such narrow bigotry as to refuse to vote for any
thoroly upright and fit man because he happens to have a particular
religious creed. Such a consideration should never be
treated as a reason for either supporting or opposing a candidate
for political office. Are you aware that there are several
States in this Union where the majority of the people are now
Catholics? I should reprobate in the severest terms the Catholics
who in those States (or in any other States) refused to vote
for the most fit man because he happened to be a Protestant;
and my condemnation would be exactly as severe for Protestants
who, under reversed circumstances, refused to vote for a
Catholic. In public life I am happy to say that I have known
many men who were elected, and constantly reëlected, to
office in districts where the great majority of their constituents
were of a different religious belief. I know Catholics who have
for many years represented constituencies mainly Protestant,
and Protestants who have for many years represented constituencies
mainly Catholic; and among the Congressmen
whom I knew particularly well was one man of Jewish faith
who represented a district in which there were hardly any Jews
at all. All of these men by their very existence in political life
refute the slander you have uttered against your fellow Americans.</p>

<p>I believe that this Republic will endure for many centuries.
If so there will doubtless be among its Presidents Protestants
and Catholics, and very probably at some time Jews. I have
consistently tried while President to act in relation to my
fellow Americans of Catholic faith as I hope that any future
President who happens to be a Catholic will act towards his
fellow Americans of Protestant faith. Had I followed any other
course I should have felt that I was unfit to represent the American
people.</p>

<p>In my Cabinet at the present moment there sit side by side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Catholic and Protestant, Christian and Jew, each man chosen
because in my belief he is peculiarly fit to exercise on behalf of
all our people the duties of the office to wich [<i>sic</i>] I have appointed
him. In no case does the man's religious belief in any
way influence his discharge of his duties, save as it makes him
more eager to act justly and uprightly in his relations to all
men. The same principles that have obtained in appointing
the members of my Cabinet, the highest officials under me,
the officials to whom is entrusted the work of carrying out all
the important policies of my administration, are the principles
upon which all good Americans should act in choosing, whether
by election or appointment, the man to fill any office from the
highest to the lowest in the land.</p>

<p class="center">
Yours truly</p>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>It is amusing sometimes to contemplate the matters
that occupy the attention of certain zealously inclined
religious persons or groups. I recall the flurry caused the
year previous by the appearance of the new five, ten, and
twenty-dollar gold pieces without the legend, "In God
We Trust," which by Roosevelt's direction had been
omitted. As a matter of fact that legend was not used on
our coins prior to 1866, when a law was passed permitting
it subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The issuance of these coins, artistically designed by
Saint-Gaudens, without the legend was merely a return
to the precedents of the fathers of the Republic. I
had a small collection of early coins at the time, none of
which bore the legend. However, when these new coins
appeared several religious bodies passed resolutions disapproving
of the President's action. Roosevelt gave out
a statement to the effect that he had always regarded that
legend as connecting God and mammon, and therefore
not as religious, but as sacrilegious. But the opinion
against the omission was so strong that in subsequent
coinage it was restored. The agitation had been somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
anticipated by the President, and he was not the least
perturbed by it. At a dinner one evening he remarked
to me, concerning it, that it was sometimes a good thing
to give people some unimportant subject to discuss, for
it helped put through more important things.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After a Cabinet meeting toward the end of November,
1908, I was talking with the President regarding various
phases of the administration of my Department, and I
mentioned one or two matters that I hoped my successor
would carry to completion. Roosevelt said to me: "Well,
I can tell you one thing that Taft told me; you will be
head of the Department under the next Administration,
if you will accept, and I want you to accept." He had
indicated this once or twice before, but had never stated
it so definitely. I had been perfectly content to finish my
term of office with the close of the Administration, but I
felt if it was the wish of both Roosevelt and Taft that
I continue I should be happy to remain.</p>

<p>Taft had evidently intended retaining several of the
Cabinet officials, but subsequently changed his mind,
which was one of the things that caused the break between
Roosevelt and him. Mr. Lawrence F. Abbott has
embodied in his excellent book, "Impressions of Theodore
Roosevelt," an article he contributed in January, 1912,
to the Cornwall, New York, local press, covering the
Roosevelt-Taft relations. Before publication this article
was sent to Roosevelt, and by him annotated and returned
to Mr. Abbott. The part regarding the retention
of Cabinet members reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Taft on his election no doubt wished to carry on the
work of his predecessor, and, if not publicly, often privately
said that it was his desire and intention to retain those Cabinet
colleagues of Mr. Roosevelt who had contributed so much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the re-creation of the Republican Party. [Note by Mr. Roosevelt:
"<i>He told me so, and authorized me to tell the Cabinet, specifically
Garfield, Straus and Luke Wright.</i>"] But this intention
became gradually modified during the winter of 1908-09.</p></blockquote>

<p>On December 16th I attended the dinner of the Ohio
Society in New York, at which President-elect Taft made
his first public address. There was a notable gathering
of the leaders of finance and commerce and of the Republican
Party, and great expectancy was evident as to what
Mr. Taft would say. Ex-Senator Spooner, a brilliant
speaker, also made an address, which contained some
pointed criticisms of Roosevelt policies. He extolled the
Constitution and in a veiled way indicated a deviation
from it on the part of Roosevelt. Spooner had made
other speeches along these lines, and I confess to some
exasperation that this occasion should have been used to
attack Roosevelt and his policies.</p>

<p>Taft was the last speaker, and I hoped that when he
arose he would resent these attacks, or at any rate uphold
the policies of the Administration of which he had been
an important member. But I was disappointed. He took
no notice of what Spooner or one or two of the other
speakers had said. To some of us this was the first evidence
that there was a rift in the relationship between
Roosevelt and Taft.</p>

<p>Mr. Taft invited me to return to Washington on the
train with him next morning. <i>En route</i> I spoke of Spooner's
speech, and said it appeared to me as an attempt to
drive a wedge between him (Taft) and the Roosevelt
policies, and that the attack was received by the great
financiers who were present, Harriman, Ryan, and
others, with great favor. Taft said he had observed it and
did not like it. He thought first that he might say something
in reply, but on second consideration he decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
let it pass. I told him that usually I enjoyed such an
occasion more when I did not have to speak, but on that
evening I very much regretted not having the opportunity
to answer that attack.</p>

<p>We talked of a number of things, but he said nothing
about desiring to have me continue in the Cabinet,
though Roosevelt had mentioned the subject to me
several times. I then concluded that while in New York
a change of mind had come to him in this matter, and
what occurred at the dinner seemed to emphasize this
conclusion. He was going down to Augusta, Georgia, for
a short vacation and asked me to come and see him; but
when I reached Washington there was much to be done
in my Department, and, as he was besieged by politicians
and I had nothing special to bring to his attention, I
thought the more considerate thing was not to take up
his time needlessly.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In January the New York delegation in Congress gave a
dinner to Vice-President-elect Sherman at the Shoreham
Hotel in Washington. There were present all the New
York Congressmen, Speaker Cannon, the junior Senator
from New York, Depew, and Senator-elect Root. Along
about ten o'clock the President arrived. As usual on such
occasions, there was informal speaking, and of course the
President was called upon. His offhand remarks that
evening were so inspiring that I regretted they were not
taken down that they might have been preserved. In my
random notes I have incorporated the substance of some
of them; to the effect that our highest purpose should be
to perform the duties before us. He said he had been in
public life twenty-six years (as I understood), and nearly
eight years of that as President, and he had enjoyed it
all; adding, humorously, "even the scraps I have had."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>Referring to the presidential duties, it was not always
possible to spell out from the words of the Constitution
what those duties imposed upon the occupant of the
office. He instanced the anti-Japanese outbreak in California.
There was nothing in the Constitution that either
permitted or conflicted with his taking the position he
had in his communications to the Governor of California.
It was his purpose to call the attention of the people at
large in that State and throughout the country to the
dangers of the situation if the contemplated legislation
were put through. He referred to the impractical attitude
of the peace societies and other peace advocates in objecting
to all appropriations for naval expenditures. They
could render a better service by agitating to prevent a
condition of international irritation that had all the possibilities
of war; the good effect of the well-considered
"Gentlemen's Agreement" with Japan had been negatived
by the unreasonable legislation proposed in California.</p>

<p>Making reference in a general way to the work of the
Administration, he said it was important to look to the
future, but to fix one's eyes on the future and neglect the
present was as unwise as to limit one's view entirely to
the present. He hoped the people would not trouble
themselves as to what to do with the ex-President; so far
as he was concerned he was able to take care of himself;
upon his return from Africa they would find him working
not as an ex-President, but as a private citizen
in the ranks, and coöperating with his party representatives
for the best interests of the country.</p>

<p>He closed by saying that what may become of one's
personal reputation, one's fame as an individual, is of no
consequence. The individual disappears. Oblivion will
engulf us all. Only results count. In order to achieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
results there must be coöperation. He was always ready
to coöperate with men whose tendencies were forward,
even if such coöperation led only one step forward where
he would have liked ten; but he would refuse to coöperate
with men whose tendencies were backward.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In my Department I continued to push matters forward
without allowing the approaching close of the Administration
to influence me. Under date of January
22d I received a letter from President-elect Taft, in
answer to my inquiry, indicating that in all probability
I should not be retained in the Cabinet. He said he
would have written sooner, but had not decided in what
capacity he wished me to serve his Administration,
though he thought perhaps I might be willing to accept
an embassy. However, he had not definitely decided not
to retain me in the Cabinet. He found Cabinet-making
quite a difficult job.</p>

<p>Three days later I received another note from him
mentioning the embassy to Japan. He hoped to suit
whatever preference I might have in the matter after
he had had a chance to talk it over with me in Washington.</p>

<p>At the last Cabinet meeting there was very little business
transacted. The President talked to us informally
and very impressively, saying he wished to repeat, what
he had said before, that a President usually receives
credit for all the good work done in his Administration,
but, speaking for himself, his co-workers had an equal
share in that credit; no President, he said, had had a
more effective, able, and coöperative Cabinet than he.
Then he added humorously that he wanted no response
to modify that statement. Some of us, however, could
not resist expressing in brief the sentiments we felt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
I answered him: If we have performed our duties to your
satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the country, it is
due in no small degree to the fact that around this table
we have caught the contagion of your fine spirit which
has enabled each of us to rise to our highest level of
efficiency because we felt we were coöperating in furthering
those moral issues which you have vitalized in our
economic and national life, I wish to add that our
President in his boundless generosity has always given
to each one of us not only the fullest credit for what we
have done, but a recognition far beyond our individual
merits.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On March 4th, at nine-thirty in the morning, the members
of the Cabinet assembled in the White House and
accompanied the President to the Capitol. We went to
the President's room on the Senate side and there awaited
the bills to be brought in for the signature of the President.
That is usual at the closing of a session, and many
bills that had been passed in the last few days came from
the engrosser for the signature of the President. Each
bill was handed to the Secretary whose department it
affected, and upon reading it over the Secretary advised
the President whether or not to sign it. There were three
bills affecting my Department, two of which I approved,
and those he signed. Of the third I had no knowledge and
so stated; that one the President passed to become law
without his signature.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock President-elect Taft came into the
room, and we all extended our congratulations to him.
Precisely at noon President Roosevelt went into the
Senate Chamber and we followed. Both he and the
President-elect took a seat before the Vice-President's
desk, and we were seated in the front row, where were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the ambassadors of the foreign powers. Vice-President
Fairbanks opened the proceedings with an appropriate
address, whereupon Vice-President-elect Sherman was
sworn in and made a brief address. The new Senators
were then sworn in in groups of four. President-elect
Taft next took the oath of office, which was administered
by Chief Justice Fuller.</p>

<p>Roosevelt then left the Senate Chamber to go to the
station. In our carriages we followed him, and at either
side marched over a thousand Republican delegates from
the City of New York. One could observe on all sides
evidence of a feeling of depression and regret at the
departure of the man who had endeared himself to the
country at large as no President had since the days of
Lincoln. It was apparent then, as the years have proven,
that he had the largest personal following ever attained
by any man in this country. By personal following I
mean one that is not dependent on office, but persists
out of office as well. People were attracted to him because
he appealed to their idealism. They had faith in him;
they had an affection for him. They believed he would
lead them where they ought to go and where, therefore,
they wished to go. It was the fact that the mass of the
people throughout the land regarded him with love and
admiration as the embodiment of their ideals of Americanism
which enabled him to exercise such a tremendous
power for the welfare of the country and which is destined
to enshrine his memory among the greatest men in
our history.</p>

<p>When we reached the station, the large room reserved
on special occasions for officials was closed, and only such
persons admitted as were identified by Secretary Loeb&mdash;members
of the family, members of the Cabinet, and a
few intimate friends. When I bade the President, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
ex-President, good-bye, he said we should meet often and
should still work together.</p>

<p>Roosevelt at the age of fifty was once more a private
citizen, having been the youngest President in our history.
I am sure I speak for my colleagues as well as for myself
when I say we felt we were parting not only from our
official chief, but from one of our nearest and dearest
friends.</p>

<p>We returned in our carriages to the White House where
we took buffet lunch with President and Mrs. Taft; then
to the stand erected in front of the White House to witness
the review.</p>

<p>My return to private life in 1909 did not prove a disturbing
transition for me, notwithstanding the fact that,
on entering the Cabinet in 1906, I had terminated all of
my professional and business interests, I had no plans
for the future. I had always entered public office not
without some trepidation, and had always retired from
such an office with a certain sense of relief and satisfaction.
But my past training and natural disposition had
by no means prepared me to be content with a life of
"elegant leisure," I soon found much to occupy my
energies, and again took part in numerous semi-public
activities, and my coöperation seemed all the more welcome
because of my experience in office both at home
and abroad.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to New York, I was formally
welcomed at a banquet at the Hotel Astor, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
auspices of a number of prominent citizens, led by William
McCarroll, who had succeeded me as president of
the New York Board of Trade when I had left for Washington.
It was, of course, gratifying to me to receive this
attention from my fellow citizens, irrespective of party,
among whom I expected to pass my remaining years.
Among the speakers were John Mitchel, St. Clair McKelway,
Richard Watson Gilder, poet and editor of the
"Century Magazine"; the Reverend Leander Chamberlain,
and Dr. Lyman Abbott. Dr. Abbott, one of America's
foremost intellectual and spiritual leaders, is the only
surviving member of this group, and I am happy to be
able to record that he is still in good health, with his pen,
which has lost nothing of its charm and vigor, ever inspiring.</p>

<p>I quite dismissed from my mind any idea of holding
office in the Taft Administration, especially after Taft
had reconsidered his statement or promise to Roosevelt
to retain me in the Cabinet. Shortly after my return from
Washington, however, on March 13, 1909, President
Taft wrote me that he would be glad to have me accept
the embassy at Constantinople, and that in time he would
transfer me to some other post that might be more acceptable.
He concluded: "I hope this will meet your
view, because I should like to have you in my administration."</p>

<p>My personal relations with Mr. Taft had of course
always been most cordial and agreeable. I wrote him
that, naturally, I had no desire to return to a post which
I had occupied twice before, unless extraordinary conditions
developed which particularly required my past experience
there and made it imperative that I accept as
a public duty, and even then I should accept only for a
short time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>The President wrote me that he would be glad to have
me accept the post at Constantinople (which had been
raised to an embassy since my last mission), and that in
time he would transfer me either to Japan or to some acceptable
post in Europe, and I soon received the following
letter from the State Department:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<i>April</i> 29, 1909
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>The President now desires me to make to you the formal
offer of the post of Ambassador to Turkey. The epoch-making
events now occurring in the Turkish Empire bring with them
difficulties and opportunities which make that post take on
even greater importance, and the President feels that your
past service and keen knowledge of the Near East make you
peculiarly qualified to take charge at this time of the important
Embassy at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Adverting to your previous conversations with the President
and with me, relative to your disinclination to accept a post
which you have previously held, I would add that the President
would be glad to consider your transfer from Constantinople to
some other post if an opportune time should arrive when this
was practicable and when you wished to relinquish the important
mission which is now tendered to you.</p>

<p>
I am, my dear Mr. Straus,
</p>

<div class="signature">Very sincerely yours<br />
<span class="smcap">P. C. Knox</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>In June, while I was getting ready for my departure, I
was compelled to undergo an operation for appendicitis.
I therefore wrote the President asking him to relieve me
of my appointment, as my illness would delay me for
another month or more. The President promptly advised
me not to be disturbed by the delay, that he would be glad
to wait until my health was entirely restored before having
me start, and that it was not possible, because of the
troubled conditions in Turkey, at that time to find any
one to replace me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>At this time I received a letter from Roosevelt, addressed
from the heart of British East Africa, expressing
pleasure at my again going to Turkey:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<span class="smcap">Saigo Soi, Lake Naivasha</span><br />
16<i>th July</i>, 1909
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Ambassador</span>:
</p>

<p>Your letter gave me real pleasure. Mrs. Roosevelt had written
of you, and your dear wife, and two beautiful daughters,
coming out to see her; and she told me how much she enjoyed
your visit. As for the address at the dedication of the memorial
window, my dear fellow, you said the very things that I would
most like to have said about me, especially coming from a man
whom I so much respect and who is my close personal friend.</p>

<p>I am delighted that you have accepted the Turkish Embassy.
The situation was wholly changed by the revolution, and at this
moment I think that Constantinople is the most important and
most interesting diplomatic post in the world.</p>

<p>I shan't try to write to you at any length, for I find it simply
impossible to keep up with correspondence here in camp, and
am able to write my letters at all at the moment only because
a friend has turned up with a typewriter.</p>

<p>I can't say how I look forward to seeing you. I know nothing
whatever of American politics at the present moment. We have
had a very successful and enjoyable trip.</p>

<p>With love to Mrs. Straus and with hearty congratulations
not to you but to our country for your having gone to Turkey,
I am</p>

<p class="center">
Faithfully yours</p>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The first paragraph refers to an address I had made in
May. The Reverend J. Wesley Hill, of the Metropolitan
Temple, had one of the windows of his church dedicated
to the Roosevelt Administration and I was asked to
deliver the principal address. I took for my subject
"The Spirit of the Roosevelt Administration," and
reviewed the leading progressive acts of the Administration
and pointed out how they were all aimed to secure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
rights and enlarge the opportunities of the plain people.
I had in mind counteracting the influence then current to
belittle the work of the Roosevelt Administration. For
with the beginning of the Taft Administration, the reactionaries
in and out of Congress had become more bitter
and outspoken in their opposition to the Roosevelt policies;
it seems that they were encouraged by the report
that a break had taken place between Roosevelt and
Taft, and by the fact that certain Senators and members
of the House who had fallen out with Roosevelt seemed
to be specially welcomed at the White House. My
address was therefore widely quoted in the press and
subsequently circulated in pamphlet form. I quote one
of its salient paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote><p>All the Roosevelt measures and policies were based not only
upon moral convictions, but upon a statesman's forethought
for the welfare of the country. That he would encounter the
powerful opposition of the offending corporate interests was to
be foreseen and expected. All reforms and reformers no less in
our country than in others have encountered the reactionaries
of privilege and power, who persuaded themselves that their
so-called vested interests, however acquired and however administered,
were their vested rights. These trespassing reactionaries
when not checked and made obedient to the legitimate
needs and righteous demands of the many produced a
spirit of revenge which broke out into revolution at the extreme
opposite end of the social system.</p></blockquote>

<p>On August 18th Mrs. Straus and I left New York on
the S.S. Prinz Friedrich Wilhelm for Cherbourg. A week
later we were in Paris, where we met Mrs. Roosevelt
with three of her children, Ethel, Archie, and Quentin.
During the fortnight of our stay we saw a great deal of
them and several times we went to the theater or sight-seeing
together. Mrs. Roosevelt told me that her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
had solicitously inquired about us in several of his letters
and suggested that I write him.</p>

<p>When we reached Constantinople on September 18th,
the month of Ramazan had begun, and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Rifaat Pasha, informed me that the
Sultan, now Mohammed V, brother of Abdul Hamid,
would probably delay receiving me for a week or ten
days, until the middle of Ramazan, and not at the end,
as was customary with the former Sultan. Accordingly
I was received on Monday, October 4th.</p>

<p>The residence of the new Sultan was in the Palace of
Dolma Bagtché. As my rank now was that of ambassador,
this audience was a more ceremonious one than
those of my former missions. Eight royal carriages came
from the Palace to conduct me and my staff to the residence
of His Royal Majesty. The first of these, in which
I rode, was a most gorgeous affair, with outriders and
two postilions in uniforms of brilliant colors standing on
a platform in the rear of the carriage. The streets of Pera
were crowded with spectators as these dazzling equipages
went by, in spite of a light rain that was falling. As we
entered the Palace, a large troop of soldiers arranged
along each side of the main gate presented arms. I was
met by the Chief Introducer of Ambassadors and several
other officials, who conducted me to the audience chamber
above. With my dragoman, Mr. Gargiulo, I then proceeded
with the Chief Introducer of Ambassadors into
the presence of the Sultan while the rest of my staff were
detained in an anteroom.</p>

<p>The Sultan was a man of about sixty-five, short and
very thick-set. He was dressed in military uniform, but
appeared physically inert and clumsy. During the whole
thirty-three years' reign of his brother, Abdul Hamid, he
had been imprisoned in a palace on the Bosphorus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
kept under constant guard. He grew up in ignorance and
his appearance clearly indicated mental backwardness.
His eyes were dull and his appearance almost that of an
imbecile, except when an occasional spark of animation
was noticeable. Withal he seemed kind and good-natured.</p>

<p>When I made my address, I felt as though I were
speaking to an image rather than a human being, and I
went through it as quickly as possible, omitting some
parts for the sake of brevity, realizing that it was simply
a form and that the Introducer of Ambassadors would
presently read the whole of it in Turkish. The Sultan
was then handed the Turkish reply to read, which he did
haltingly, even consulting the Introducer at times to
decipher a word. That being over, the doors to the anteroom
were thrown open and my staff entered, also the
consul-general and his staff, and each man was presented
to the Sultan. We were then conducted back to the anteroom
and served with cigarettes and coffee, even though
it was Ramazan, when Mohammedans do not drink or
smoke until after sundown. In a few minutes more we
were conducted back to our carriages. The whole function
was more in the nature of mimicry on the stage than a
serious diplomatic performance.</p>

<p>With my dragoman I paid my official calls upon the
Grand Vizier and the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the
Porte, both of whom received me in full-dress uniform
and immediately returned the calls.</p>

<p>The Government of Turkey under the new régime, with
a Sultan who was merely a figurehead, was in the hands
of the ministry, and the ministers in turn were appointed
and controlled by the Young Turks, or so-called party of
"Union and Progress" which had brought on the revolution
of 1908 and deposed the late Sultan in April, 1909.
It required no great insight to see that a government thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
controlled by an invisible power without official responsibility
could not be one of either liberty or progress; yet
the leading ministers were men of ability and some of
them men of considerable experience. Rifaat Pasha, for
instance, was formerly ambassador to London, an intelligent
and thoroughly enlightened statesman. Hussein
Hilmi Pasha, the Grand Vizier, was the former member
of a joint committee charged with the government of
Macedonia. Talaat Bey, the Minister of the Interior,
had previously held an inferior position. He was one of
the leading representatives of the Young Turk Party and
was believed to be the one mainly responsible for the
terrible slaughter and martyrdom of Armenians during
the World War. After that war he fled to Berlin, where,
in 1920, he was assassinated by a young Armenian.
Djavid Bey, Minister of Finance, was a remarkably
brilliant young man, about thirty-four years old, from
Salonica. It was said he was a Donmeh; that is, a member
of a sect of apostate Jews also known as Sabbatians
from the name of its Messiah or prophet, Sabbataï Zevi,
who gave the sect its romantic origin in the middle of the
seventeenth century. Professor Graetz gives a full and
interesting description of this whole movement in his
"History of the Jews."</p>

<p>Among my colleagues were Gerard Lowther, who
represented Great Britain; Marquis Imperiali, Italy; and
Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, Germany. Because of
the lack of general society in Constantinople, the members
of the diplomatic corps became very intimate with
one another, and this was so with my colleagues generally
and especially between the German ambassador and
myself, for we were also fellow members of the Hague
Tribunal, and in 1907 he was chairman of the German
delegation at the Conferences. He was by far the ablest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and most forceful diplomat in Constantinople at this
period. During his term of office there, German influence
in the Ottoman Empire entirely overshadowed the British.
This influence started its ascendancy following the
visit of the Emperor in 1898, when he obtained the promise
of the concession for the building of the Bagdad Railway.</p>

<p>When first the Ottoman Government granted this
concession, the financiers of Great Britain, France, and
Germany had come to a tentative agreement for the
joint construction of the road. The Germans then
wanted more than an equal control in the enterprise, and
the negotiations fell through. Had the interests of Great
Britain and Germany been united in the Near East,
there probably would have been quite a different alignment
of Powers on the chessboard of Europe, and perhaps
the World War would have been prevented. The Bagdad
Railway, if jointly constructed, would have contributed
to a better understanding between Great Britain and Germany
instead of accentuating more and more their differences
as the road proceeded toward the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>I could plainly see evidences, both in social life in the
Turkish capital and in the unmistakable trend of diplomatic
alignments, of a rapidly developing entente between
Great Britain, France, and Russia. Since the Russo-Japanese
War, and with the coming of the new régime in
Turkey, Russia had changed her attitude toward Turkey
and had become extremely friendly. Italy maintained a
neutral attitude as between Great Britain and Germany.
Austria, as always, if not controlled by, was in close sympathy
with, Germany.</p>

<p>Abdul Hamid had developed into the most autocratic
ruler of modern times. With the overthrow of his régime
and its colossal system of secret agents, there was hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
for a gradual development of a parliamentary government,
especially as some of the officials in the Turkish
ministry were forward-looking men, of considerable
ability and honesty of purpose. However, just as the
jealousy between the Great Powers had prevented the dismemberment
of the Ottoman Empire for a hundred years
or more, so the same jealousy prevented rehabilitation.
Great Britain favored the building up of Turkey; the
policy of Russia, Germany, and Austria was to keep
Turkey weak and disorganized.</p>

<p>With the establishment of the new régime Germany,
England, France, and Italy sought concessions from the
Government for the development of mines and the building
of railroads, docks, and other public utilities. The
country was rich and undeveloped, and the Turks themselves
had neither the capacity nor the money for such
undertakings. But the effect of these concessions was
undermining the sovereignty and was foreshadowing
conflict.</p>

<p>With the passing of the old régime and the beginning of
the new, an appalling massacre of Armenians had taken
place in Cilicia; and it was believed that this massacre,
which cost the lives of twenty thousand or more victims,
was engineered by the old régime to discredit the new.</p>

<p>The first fall of the new ministry was brought about by
what was known as the Lynch affair, which concerned a
steamship monopoly of an English company on the Tigris
and Euphrates. The Lynch Company had a perpetual
concession to navigate two steamers from the Persian
Gulf to Bassora, and from there to Bagdad on the Tigris
and as far as navigable on the Euphrates. There was also
a Turkish company with a similar concession, and the
English company undertook negotiations with the Grand
Vizier for the consolidation of the two companies, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
which the Lynch Company was to pay the Ottoman
Government £160,000 in cash. The new company was to
have a grant for seventy-two years, with the right given
to the Ottoman Government to buy it all out at the end
of thirty-six years on a basis to be agreed upon. The new
company was to have the monopoly of the navigation,
and it was to have an English president with a board of
directors composed half of Englishmen and half of Turkish
subjects.</p>

<p>The arrangements were made on behalf of the ministry
by the Grand Vizier, Hilmi Pasha, and the matter was
then brought up under interpellation in the Parliament.
The first vote taken was against confirmation of the
transaction. This amounted to an expression of lack of
confidence in the ministry, whereupon the Grand Vizier
stated that unless the transaction was confirmed, he and
his colleagues would resign. Two days later, on motion
of Djavid Bey, the eloquent Minister of Finance, the
whole matter was reconsidered and an equally large vote
cast confirming the transaction. Aside from registering
confidence or the lack of it in the ministry, the vote
against confirmation would also have been interpreted as
an act of hostility toward England. For the time being
the problem was settled.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, however, there arose in the Bagdad
vilayet such opposition to this transaction that the deputies
from that province threatened to withdraw from
Parliament. The negotiations were regarded as a victory
for England in the strengthening of her influence along
the Persian Gulf, and a defeat for the Germans, whose
railway terminus would be at Bassora, at the junction of
the two rivers. The Persian Gulf, on the other hand, was
of strategic interest to Great Britain because it is the
corridor to India. German influence proved the stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
with the Young Turks, and the consolidation of the Lynch
Company with the Turkish company was not confirmed.</p>

<p>This vote resulted in the fall of the ministry, for a
month later the Young Turks forced the resignation of
the Grand Vizier. In giving his resignation to the Sultan,
the Grand Vizier stated his reason as poor health, but
that was merely for public consumption. Talaat Bey and
Djavid Bey were known to be prominent members of the
Young Turks, and the Grand Vizier, who had been Minister
of the Interior and then Grand Vizier under the
former Sultan, was not fully trusted as being in accord
with the régime of the Young Turks. To bridge over this
ministerial crisis the Young Turks offered to Hakki
Pasha, ambassador at Rome, the grand viziership, which
he accepted.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Early in the year 1910 the diplomatic circle in Constantinople
was thrown, if not into gloom, at least into
official mourning. The Grand Duke Nicolaiovich, uncle
of Czar Nicholas of Russia, and King Leopold of Belgium,
died. At Constantinople, more than at any capital
in the world, ceremonies of any kind were exaggerated to
make an impression upon the Turkish mind. And so in
both these instances elaborate funeral services were held
which the diplomatic representatives attended in full
uniform, loaded with all decorations. The service for the
Grand Duke lasted about two hours, although no one
apparently listened to any part but the singing, and there
was a general sigh of relief when it was over. The service
for the Belgian king was of a similar nature, with the
addition of a huge catafalque, surmounted by a crown,
erected in the center of the church, which was so cold
that most of us kept on our overcoats.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter I attended a third funeral, this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a Turkish one. Hamdy Bey, director and organizer of
the Imperial Museum, had died on February 24, 1910,
at about sixty-eight years of age. I had known him for
twenty years; he had always been courteous and obliging
to American visitors, and had shown many special favors
to me, notably in regard to the permit for the Babylonian
excavations. The services took place at eleven in the
morning in front of the entrance to the Sophia Mosque.
The funeral cortège consisted of about a dozen dervishes
clad in long black robes with high conical head-coverings
made of rough yellowish-gray woolen material, and
about three times the height of an ordinary fez. They
chanted in plaintive tones, "Allah! Allah! Allah!"
Next came the coffin-bearers, six in number. As is the
custom among the Mohammedans, the coffin was of
plain boards, covered with shawls, over which was draped
a black covering with some phrases from the Koran
worked into it. On top of the coffin was the red fez or
head-covering of the deceased. Behind the coffin walked
many of the leading officials of the Government and
other prominent people. The entire ministry was present.
I joined the procession shortly before reaching the mosque
and was asked to walk beside Rifaat Pasha, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs. I was the only representative of a
foreign power present, and my attendance was warmly
appreciated by the Turkish officials and by the relatives
of the deceased.</p>

<p>When the procession reached the mosque, the coffin
was placed upon the pediment of a Greek column near the
entrance, an appropriate place for it to rest, I thought.
All the mourners having gathered round, one of the imans
or priests standing by the coffin recited a prayer of about
six minutes' duration, in the midst of which he put the
following questions in Turkish to the bystanders:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"You all knew Hamdy Bey; what kind of a man was
he?"</p>

<p>And the audience replied "Eyi," meaning "good."</p>

<p>"If he has done any wrong to you, do you forgive
him?"</p>

<p>Their reply in Turkish signified, "We do."</p>

<p>The body was then borne on the shoulders of the carriers
to the museum enclosure which was near by, in front
of the Chinili Kiosque. Djavid Bey then mounted the
marble portico and from there delivered a funeral oration
lasting about twelve minutes, in which he referred to the
excellent work accomplished by the deceased under the
most trying circumstances during the reign of corruption
and oppression, and pointed to the buildings surrounding
the enclosure as the most fitting and lasting memorial.</p>

<p>A funeral among the Mohammedans is not regarded as
a cause for mourning. Death is looked upon as a matter of
course. Every respect is shown the memory of the deceased,
but there is neither sanctimony nor suppressed
sorrow at the funeral service. This is doubtless due to the
spirit of fatalism deeply embedded in their religion, and
which colors so deeply the life and philosophy of a Mohammedan.</p>

<p>The attitude of prayer on the part of the bystanders
during this ceremony was one I had never observed at
the ordinary services in the mosques. They all stood
erect, arms horizontally extended forward from the elbow,
palms turned upward. The simplicity of the whole
service impressed me very much. The entire dramatic
scene, in its picturesque surroundings, was unforgettable.
The day was bright and beautiful, and the Bosphorus
wore its most attractive coloring. Turkish functions,
whether official or ceremonial, are always arranged with
quiet dignity and precision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>Among the pleasant things during this sojourn in Constantinople
was a trip to Cairo to meet Roosevelt. On
New Year's Day, 1910, I received a note from him
scribbled off in pencil, asking that I meet him if possible
about March 22d at Cairo; he would wire me later from
the upper Nile a more exact date. He could not come to
Constantinople because he had to include Christiania in
his itinerary, which made it a little difficult to carry out
his plans.</p>

<p>In due time I received a telegram from him from Gondokoro,
on the lower Nile, to meet him on March 23d.
Accordingly Mrs. Straus and I started from Constantinople
on March 7th in the embassy dispatch boat, Scorpion,
a ship of about seven hundred and fifty tons, manned
by a crew of seventy-five or eighty bluejackets. We left
a little early in order to be able to make stops at several
ports on the way, notably Salonica, which in many respects
was the most advanced city of the empire. It had
about 135,000 inhabitants, of whom some 20,000 were
Greek, 15,000 Bulgarian and other Balkan peoples, and
the rest chiefly Jews. The ancestors of many of the latter
had settled there centuries before as refugees from Spain
at the time of the Inquisition. As was the case with many
of the other Jews of Turkey their language was Ladino,
a Spanish dialect.</p>

<p>We stayed at Salonica three days and visited the principal
institutions of the city, and the Jewish hospitals and
schools, all of which I found superior to any I had seen
in Turkey proper. They were conducted on modern scientific
lines. The leaders of finance and industry were the
Jews and the Greeks, while at the same time the hewers
of wood and the drawers of water, those who loaded the
ships and did the hauling, were also principally Jews.</p>

<p>Next we stopped at Athens, where we met my brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Isidor and his wife, who were making a tour of the Orient.
Our six-days' stay in Athens was made delightful for us by
the courtesies of our minister, George H. Moses, now and
for some years past United States Senator from New
Hampshire. We visited the Boulé, or Greek Chamber,
one afternoon. What mainly impressed one was the
lack of decorum and dignity. The Minister of War, who
also represented the military league, was the dominating
power. I thought then how unfortunate it was for a
country to be ruled by the sabered politician. Then truly
does the army become a curse to the Government, as
well as inefficient for the protection it is supposed to give.
When the army enters politics, then politics also enters
the army, a double calamity for any state. But that
seemed to be the lamentable condition of Greece as I saw
it at that time.</p>

<p>We were received in audience by King George, who
spoke perfect English. I had met him before, on my visit
to Athens in 1888. He conversed freely and with the
objectiveness of an outsider about the disturbed political
conditions of Greece, which was at the time dominated
by a military league, a secret organization of army officers.
Referring to this league, the King said that outsiders
probably regarded him as weak in giving way to
its demands, but that they did not appreciate conditions;
he did it to prevent a revolution, and he hoped that unity
among the people might be promoted by the approaching
meeting of the Assembly for the revision of the constitution.</p>

<p>He seemed remarkably well informed regarding our
system of government and American affairs generally.
He said that Greece needed a council of state with coördinate
legislative power, rather than a senate. He appeared
to favor a small appointed body rather than an elective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
senate. He said he had been in Greece for fifty years; he
had come there when he was eighteen and was educated
for the navy. He added drily that it might have been
better if he had stuck to the profession of his training.</p>

<p>He knew I was on my way to Egypt to meet Roosevelt
for whom he expressed the greatest admiration. He said
he had read several of Roosevelt's books and had always
had a desire to meet him.</p>

<p>We went on to Alexandria by the Roumanian boat.
The sea seemed rough, so we thought best to send the
Scorpion on ahead so that we might make the trip leisurely,
and on March 21st we arrived in Cairo, where
Consul-General Iddings had reserved rooms for us at the
Shepheard Hotel, adjoining the suite reserved for the
Roosevelts.</p>

<p>The Roosevelt party arrived from Luxor at about nine
o'clock on the morning of March 24th. We went to the
station to meet the train, and there was quite a gathering,
including the consul-general and his wife, an aide of the
Khedive, an aide of the Sirdar, a number of American
missionaries, and several others. Cairo was astir. American
flags were flying on many buildings, and at the hotel
a great crowd cheered as Roosevelt entered.</p>

<p>After breakfast the first morning, Roosevelt wanted me
to read several letters he had dictated, among others a
reply to the invitation that had been extended by the
Kaiser asking Roosevelt to be his guest in the palace in
Berlin. The invitation did not include Mrs. Roosevelt,
and this he resented. He therefore dictated a letter to
Ambassador David J. Hill saying he would be pleased to
call on the Emperor on the day designated, but could not
accept the invitation to be his guest, as he did not purpose
to separate from Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked Ambassador
Hill to be sure to submit the message to the Emperor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
chamberlain in such a way that it could not be construed
as a hint for an invitation for Mrs. Roosevelt. I advised
against sending this letter and asked him to let me handle
the matter. This I did, and Ambassador Hill soon discovered,
what I had suspected, that the Emperor was
not aware at the time the invitation was sent that Mrs.
Roosevelt was with her husband. The omission was immediately
corrected.</p>

<p>Roosevelt was, of course, anxious for news from home.
He spoke again of Taft's having told him he would retain
Garfield and myself, and said Taft was aware that he
(Roosevelt) was specially attached to us both. I showed
him an article in a current "North American Review,"
entitled "The First Year of Taft's Administration,"
which plainly showed that much ground had been
lost.</p>

<p>Roosevelt was to deliver an address before the Egyptian
National University. He handed me the draft of it
and asked me to criticize it freely. I suggested a number of
changes, which he promptly adopted. He had been asked
not to refer to the recent assassination of the Premier of
Egypt, Budros Pasha&mdash;a deed that had probably been
inspired by the Nationalists, a party composed chiefly of
young students, half-educated theorists, and a few others
whose shibboleth was "Egypt for the Egyptians." Roosevelt
considered that it would be cowardly and evasive to
avoid this subject, and that usually the subjects one is
asked not to refer to are the ones uppermost in the minds
of the people. Besides, if he did not openly condemn such
an act, his silence might be interpreted as an approval.
In view of all the circumstances I fully agreed with him.
The speech was delivered in a large hall filled to capacity;
the consular body and many Egyptian ministers were
present. About one third of the audience understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
English, and the address was enthusiastically received,
and had an excellent effect, as I afterward learned, upon
law and order in Egypt.</p>

<p>Roosevelt gave a luncheon at the hotel to Sir Gaston
Maspero and Professor Sayce, the eminent Egyptologists,
which we attended. There were about fifteen people
present, among them Mr. Lawrence F. Abbott, of "The
Outlook," who had joined the Roosevelt party at Khartum.
It was a delightful occasion and reminded us of the
old days at the White House. Roosevelt always had the
faculty of surrounding himself with people who, whether
from prominent or humble walks of life, were worth while.
There were so many facets to his nature that he could
make interesting contacts with all sorts of folk, those of
the forest as well as those of the closet.</p>

<p>From Gondokoro, Roosevelt had written Ambassador
Leishman at Rome saying he would be glad of the honor
of presentation to His Holiness Pope Pius X. At Cairo
he received the following cable reply from Ambassador
Leishman:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Rector of the American Catholic College, Monsignor
Kennedy, in reply to inquiry which I caused to be made, requests
that the following communication be transmitted to you:
"The Holy Father will be delighted to grant audience to Mr.
Roosevelt on April 5, and hopes nothing will arise to prevent it,
such as the much-regretted incident which made the reception
of Mr. Fairbanks impossible."</p>

<p>I merely transmit this communication without having committed
you in any way to accept the conditions imposed, as the
form appears objectionable, clearly indicating that an audience
would be canceled in case you should take any action while
here that might be construed as countenancing the Methodist
mission work here....</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks, it may be remembered, was granted an
audience with His Holiness, but on the same day accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
an invitation to lecture before the Methodist body in
Rome whose propaganda was inimical to the Vatican.
This displeased His Holiness and the audience was thereupon
canceled.</p>

<p>Roosevelt answered Leishman's cable to the effect that
while he fully recognized the right of the Holy Father to
receive or not to receive whomsoever he chose, he could
not submit to conditions which would in any way limit
his freedom of conduct. But the Vatican stood firm on
the conditions set forth:</p>

<blockquote><p>His Holiness will be much pleased to grant an audience to
Mr. Roosevelt, for whom he entertains great esteem, both
personally and as President of the United States. His Holiness
quite recognizes Mr. Roosevelt's entire right to freedom of
conduct. On the other hand, in view of the circumstances, for
which neither His Holiness nor Mr. Roosevelt is responsible,
an audience could not occur except on the understanding expressed
in the former message.</p></blockquote>

<p>Consequently, while Roosevelt did not go to the Vatican,
he was received with great cordiality at the Quirinal
by King Victor Emmanuel III. In order not to have the
Vatican incident misunderstood at home, Roosevelt sent
a message regarding it to the American people, through
the pages of "The Outlook" of April 9, 1910. Mr. Abbott
makes detailed mention of the episode in his "Impressions
of Theodore Roosevelt."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mrs. Straus and I were invited to luncheon with Sir
Eldon and Lady Gorst, British consul-general at Cairo,
where we met Professor Oscar Browning, of Cambridge,
among others. Sir Eldon was the successor of Lord
Cromer, and had had many years of experience in Egypt
in official capacities. He spoke of the unrest among the
natives, especially those who had lived abroad as university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
students. These were in fact the leaders of the Nationalist
Party, a movement stimulated by the establishment
of the new régime in Turkey and the parliamentary
form of government in Persia. Some of the Arabic papers
were encouraging, if not actually inciting, opposition to
the British protectorate. He said the British policy was
to grant by degrees an always larger share of local self-government,
but it was feared that if the national spirit
was too much encouraged there would be a reversion to
conditions that prevailed prior to the British occupation
of the country. He explained that Lord Cromer's administration
covered the period of national improvements,
such as the reform of taxes, and the building of
railways and irrigation works; and that now had come the
desire for political changes.</p>

<p>I have referred to that part of Roosevelt's speech at the
National University in which he condemned the assassination
of the premier. Sir Eldon said he had been consulted
in regard to the speech before its delivery, and
that if he had expressed any objection he was sure Mr.
Roosevelt would either have omitted that part of the
address or declined to speak altogether, for he knew Mr.
Roosevelt would not do anything to embarrass British
interests. He had had no objection, and made this clear
to Mr. Iddings, who made the inquiry.</p>

<p>We were all invited to a tea at the German Diplomatic
Agency, to meet the Prince and Princess Eitel Friedrich,
who were on a visit to Egypt. Eitel Friedrich is the second
son of William II of Germany. I had little opportunity
to speak with him because he and Roosevelt were
engaged almost the entire time in an animated conversation,
during which both remained standing. My impression
of the Prince was that he seemed tremendously impressed
with his own importance. I had a pleasant chat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
with the Princess, whom I found very charming. She
seemed to me of a type more Austrian than German.</p>

<p>On March 30th we left Cairo, going with the Roosevelt
party as far as Alexandria, where they boarded a ship for
Naples, and we went aboard the Scorpion. Our little ship
was dressed in its complimentary flags, the band was
playing, and the commander had drawn up the bluejackets
on the main deck to present arms, so that the
Roosevelt party was being saluted with all the form,
splendor, and dignity that our ship could muster. The
sea was much calmer than when we came, and we reached
Constantinople in a little less than three days. I had
intended stopping at several other ports to confer with
our consuls, and to visit Jerusalem, Beirut, and Smyrna;
but as my instructions were to hasten my return I did so.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During my third mission in Turkey I saw quite a good
deal of Mahmoud Chevket Pasha, the generalissimo of
the Turkish army, who was at the same time Minister of
War. He was fifty-two years old, of spare frame, medium
height, with a full beard that was turning gray. He was
an Arab, born in Bagdad. He told me that, when he was
a younger man and a major in the army, he spent ten
years in Germany studying the German military system
and training. It was evident to every observer that under
his generalship the Turkish army had vastly improved
both in appearance and in discipline.</p>

<p>I found him a well-educated, modern man. At that
time he enjoyed a world-wide reputation as the most
important and dominating official in the empire, because,
as general of the Third Army Corps, stationed at Salonica,
he had marched his men to Constantinople, dethroned
the late Sultan, and established the new régime.
Within a few months he had made visits to Austria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
France, and Germany, and was received with great
honors. In the leading cities of these countries he made
addresses that were statesmanlike and internationally
tactful. Throughout he represented his country with
admirable tact and judgment.</p>

<p>During one of our conversations the generalissimo told
me that the only cloud on the horizon was the effort of the
Greeks to make the Island of Crete a part of their country.
He thought the general conditions in Turkey were good
and that there was no danger of internal troubles, because
the Government had things well in hand. Should Greece
make any hostile move, he knew Turkey could easily
defeat her. He did not think that any of the Balkan
Powers would join Greece, since they could not do so without
drawing in some of the big Powers, and the latter
would not, as a matter of self-interest, allow the Balkan
States to join Greece in a war.</p>

<p>We were speaking rather frankly, and I asked him
whether he thought Russia desired the advancement of
Turkey and its steady growth under the new régime. He
realized that Russia was then entirely friendly, but said
it was not because she favored a progressive Turkey, but
because since her war with Japan she was in no position
to take advantage of the misfortunes of Turkey. I asked
him what he thought of the real attitude of Germany. He
answered that he thought Germany entirely friendly;
that her desire was, of course, to advance her commercial
interests in the Ottoman Empire, but that in this respect
she was perhaps not different from other nations who
regarded Turkey as a good field for commercial operations.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the political atmosphere was considerably
disturbed by the Crete affair, just as Chevket
Pasha had foreseen. The Greek army had entered politics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and dominated the Government. It caused several
changes of ministers and forced the King to consent to
the summoning of a National Assembly consisting of
twice as many delegates as there were members in Parliament.
Crete also insisted upon sending delegates, which
would have been tantamount to incorporating itself as
part of Greece politically.</p>

<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs frankly told the ambassadors
of all the leading Powers, as well as the Greek
minister, that if the Greek National Assembly admitted
delegates from Crete, Turkey would regard that as a
<i>casus belli</i>. There was a rumor at the same time that
Bulgaria was preparing to take advantage of the crisis to
make war on Turkey, either by uniting with Greece or in
conjunction with some of the other Balkan States. The
Minister of Foreign Affairs had managed well, and the
four big Powers, England, Russia, France, and Italy,
bestirred themselves and the situation was allayed for
the time.</p>

<p>Greece had purchased from Italy a man-of-war of
about ten thousand tons, which was being fitted and
armored for delivery within six months. To offset this
augmentation of the Greek navy, already stronger than
the Turkish, Turkey wanted to purchase a man-of-war
of sufficient size to outclass the one being fitted for
Greece. The Minister of Foreign Affairs called on me
with a memorandum of the size of the ship and the
strength of the armament desired, together with a statement
that the object of the Ottoman Government in the
purchase of it was not to make war, but to safeguard the
peace of Turkey and possibly of Europe. It was thought
that the moral effect upon Greece of such a purchase
would prevent her from taking any action that would
cause war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>I cabled this proposal in detail to Secretary Knox, and
requested a reply by cable. I knew that we had several
ships that would probably answer the requirements of
Turkey, and I thought that, aside from the moral effect
this might have in preventing a war between Turkey and
Greece, it would enable us to substitute a new ship of our
own for an old one. It was not a question of price, as
Turkey had put aside sufficient money to pay for such
a ship.</p>

<p>A few days later Chevket Pasha also called on me,
and again assured me that the purchase was designed to
have an immediate effect upon the maintenance of peace,
and that the people of Turkey would be forever grateful
to the United States if we should sell them the ship.</p>

<p>But after the lapse of a week or more, I finally received
a negative answer from the State Department, saying
that such a sale could not be made without the authority
of Congress. This, of course, I knew; but since the transaction
would have given us the opportunity to add a new
ship to replace the other, I thought such legislation might
readily have been obtained. The Turkish Government
then made application to Germany, and that country
seized the opportunity further to cement its friendly relations
with the Ottoman Empire, which later had such
an important bearing in the World War.</p>

<p>About a year after this Crete affair, Chevket Pasha
was assassinated as he was coming out of the Sublime
Porte. No greater loss could have befallen Turkey than
the removal at that time of her greatest general and most
enlightened statesman. He was the best-informed Turkish
statesman I have ever known, with a clear and correct
view of the entire European situation. What the conspiracy
was behind this shooting was never brought to light.</p>

<p>The affairs of Crete at that time were in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the energetic and brilliant leader who has since come to
be regarded as one of the foremost statesmen of all Europe,
Eleutherios Venizelos. At the Paris Peace Conference
his recognition was complete. The Greeks, however,
have always shown themselves to be a fickle and
ungrateful people, and from the time of Socrates have
turned against their foremost philosophers and statesmen,
and their attitude toward Venizelos is the most
recent illustration of those traits. Venizelos is practically
a refugee from his own country and at this writing is
visiting our country to study American institutions.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The main reason I accepted the post at Turkey for the
third time was to secure the legal status and rights of
American institutions under definite laws in the new
régime. The Turks had promulgated a law, known as the
"Law of Associations," under the ingenious restrictions
of which they sought to place all foreign institutions.
That would have given the Ottoman authorities, both
civil and judicial, the power so to impede the work of
these institutions as to prevent them from functioning.
I pointed out to the Grand Vizier that the Law of Associations
was contrary to the acquired rights of the institutions,
which had been legally recognized for many years,
and taking section by section I showed him the inapplicability
of it to these institutions. After months of
negotiations, as usual in Turkey, I succeeded in getting
a decision from the Council of Ministers exempting foreign
institutions of a religious, educational, or benevolent
character.</p>

<p>There were three or four other matters that I succeeded
in bringing to a successful close. Contrary to the real-property
laws of 1868, our institutions were being denied
the right to hold in their names real property necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for their operation, and this right I was able to secure for
them. Among other things I obtained a charter for the
Syrian Protestant College at Beirut, and I got an iradé or
permit for the construction of new buildings for Robert
College. The American College for Girls, at Scutari on
the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, wanted to transfer the
institution over to Arnaoutkeui on the European side,
its present location, and I secured permission for this
transfer and for the construction of its buildings.</p>

<p>While these various negotiations were in progress, I
received an instruction from Secretary Knox at which I
took umbrage. It contained the following paragraph:
"If I am correct in understanding that American educational
and missionary interests in Turkey are in fact
receiving treatment in substance entirely satisfactory, I
conclude that the chief influence should at present be
centered upon a substantial advancement of our prestige
and commerce."</p>

<p>This had no other meaning than that instead of vigorous
effort for the protection of American colleges, schools,
and hospitals, whose rights under the new régime were
being seriously threatened by new laws and regulations,
I was to transfer my efforts to securing shipbuilding and
railway concessions. I promptly advised the Department
that this understanding was not correct, that the interests
of our institutions were being seriously threatened, and
that the proper protection of these interests in no way
conflicted with the advancement of our commercial
interests.</p>

<p>I continued to push the negotiations on behalf of our
institutions, for I knew that a let-up at that time would,
instead of benefiting our commercial interests, convey the
impression of weakness on the part of our Government
in looking out for American interests. In several dispatches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I pointed out to the Department that to exert
official pressure for railway concessions in Turkey would
likewise require the protection of such concessions, when
obtained, by strenuous official action which might at
some time even involve the use of force, and could not fail
to enmesh us in the intricate political problems of the
Near East. I asked the Department to weigh carefully
the possible advantage of concessions to a few American
exploiters, against the serious disadvantages that the
protection of these concessions would impose. I pointed
out that invariably the Turkish Government, of its own
accord or through outside pressure, failed to live up to its
contracts if not compelled to do so, and that the situation
would be further complicated by the conflicting
interests of the other Powers whose commercial dealings
were subordinate to their political strategy. To ordinary
commercial transactions, such as export and import,
these risks did not, of course, apply; but they were particularly
troublesome with regard to the building and
running of railways on Turkish territory.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Among our distinguished visitors during this mission
were former Vice-President and Mrs. Fairbanks, who
were on their tour round the world. They were our guests
for a week, and we gave a series of dinners to have them
meet the leading diplomatic and Turkish officials. Among
the latter was Ahmed Riza Bey, president of the Chamber
of Deputies, who had for twenty years been a refugee in
Paris, where he edited a Turkish paper. He spoke French
fluently. He was said to be practically the head of the
Young Turks Party. He was blue-eyed, handsome, and
thoroughly modern. His father was one of the chamberlains
of Sultan Abdul Aziz, and his mother, an Austrian,
once told Mrs. Straus that she had almost forgotten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
German language because she had not used it in so long
a time, for she was only seventeen when she was married.</p>

<p>Riza Bey was very much interested to learn from Mr.
Fairbanks the rules of parliamentary procedure. The
Chamber of Deputies had not as yet adopted any such
rules and its proceedings lacked system and order.</p>

<p>A few days later, while the president of the Chamber
was calling on me, the palace of the Chamber of Deputies,
Tcheragan on the Bosphorus, burned to the ground,&mdash;an
unfortunate occurrence not only because of the material
loss, but because it was looked upon by the populace as a
visitation from God against the new régime.</p>

<p>Judge and Mrs. Alton B. Parker and the widow of
Daniel Manning, Secretary of the Treasury in Cleveland's
second Cabinet, also gave us the pleasure of a visit.
And a little later Cleveland H. Dodge arrived in his yacht.
He was heartily welcomed by all the missionaries, for he
was prominently connected with Robert College and was
chairman of the board of trustees of the College at Beirut.
In his party was Mrs. Grover Cleveland.</p>

<p>After we had moved to our summer quarters at Yenikeui,
Kermit Roosevelt and his classmate, John Heard,
came to spend about ten days with us. My son Roger,
then a student at Princeton, was spending his vacation
with us and was glad to have the company of two young
men of about his own age.</p>

<p>At this time we saw much of Sir William Willcocks, the
eminent British engineer, who had just returned from
Bagdad where he was employed by the Turkish Government
in the construction and supervision of irrigation
works in Mesopotamia. It was he who projected and
designed the Assuan Dam across the Nile. He told me he
was born to his work, as his father, Captain W. Willcocks,
was engaged in it in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>In June I wrote the Department of State requesting
a leave of absence toward the end of September or
beginning of October, with permission to return home.
In answer I received a cable from the assistant secretary
to the effect that the railway concessions of
the Ottoman American Development Company were
to come up in Parliament in November, and asking if
it would be convenient for me to take my leave earlier
so as to be back in Turkey by November 1st. I replied
in a confidential letter that it was my intention, upon my
return to America, to confer with the President and the
Secretary of State regarding my release from this post,
in accordance with my understanding when I accepted
the appointment. I decided to wait until the arrival of
the new secretary of the embassy, Mr. Hoffman Philip,
and before leaving I took pains to make him thoroughly
familiar with the work of the embassy so that no ground
might be lost pending my resignation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On leaving Constantinople we desired a few days' rest
in the mountains. At the suggestion, therefore, of our
minister to Roumania, J. Ridgely Carter, we planned to
go to Sinaia, the Roumanian summer capital, which he
thought we should find agreeable in every way, so on
September 3d we left Turkey for Roumania.</p>

<p>Sinaia we found not only very beautiful, but most
enjoyable. We were invited to the Palace a number of
times. The Court being in mourning, all entertaining
was informal and more intimate. The King reminded me
of the late Edmund Clarence Stedman in general appearance.
The Queen, known to all the world as "Carmen
Sylva," was a striking personality, tall, rather heavily
built, with silver gray hair and a high complexion, strong,
mobile features, and a very spiritual expression. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
spoke English, French, and German with equal fluency,
so that it was difficult to tell which was the most natural
to her.</p>

<p>The Queen told me how she happened to choose Carmen
Sylva for a pen-name: The woods always appealed to
her; their stillness and beauty inspired her. When she
began to publish her work, at the age of thirty-five, she
asked a certain German writer to tell her the Latin word
for "woods"; that gave her "sylva." Next she asked
the Latin word for "bird," but that did not suit her.
Then the word for "song" suggested itself, "carmen."
The combination appealed to her poetic sense, and she
adopted it.</p>

<p>At luncheon one day our conversation drifted to poetry
and American poets. The Queen seemed to know all our
bards, even the minor ones, several of whom I had not
heard of myself. I happened to quote, as near as I could
recall it, a couplet from a little poem that Joaquin Miller
wrote when Peter Cooper died:</p>

<p class="center">
All one can hold in his cold right hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is what he has given away.</span><br />
</p>

<p>She was most enthusiastic about that sentiment and said
she considered it real poetry. She repeated it several
times so as to remember it.</p>

<p>"Whenever any one gives me a beautiful thought, I
never forget him," she said, turning to me in her unaffected
manner. I appreciated her delicate compliment.</p>

<p>After luncheon she invited me to the floor above to see
her study. She explained that she did her best work in a
little cell-like room in the monastery below the hill near
the Palace, which we had visited the day before. There
she was most free from disturbance of any kind. Her
study in the Palace was comfortable and attractively
furnished; not large, but cozy. Looking out of the windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
one saw the terraced Italian gardens and the
wooded peaks of the Carpathian Mountains beyond.
The low bookcases which lined the four walls contained
English, French, and German books in exquisite bindings.
At her desk were three typewriters, respectively
from England, France, and Germany, for use in writing
the languages of those countries. She used them herself,
according to the language in which the inspiration of the
moment had come. She presented me with a volume of
poems and one of essays, both in German, "Meine Ruhe"
and "Mein Penatenwinkel," which she inscribed for me.</p>

<p>We went through the Palace that afternoon. It is
modern and very beautiful, furnished in excellent taste,
and not cold and uncomfortable, sacrificed to grandeur,
as most palaces seem to be. Then the King and Queen
invited us to return the next morning at eleven, to a musicale
and luncheon.</p>

<p>Next day after luncheon the King left the other guests
and took me into a small adjoining room where we smoked
and had coffee. Knowing that I had been Secretary of
Commerce and Labor, he led the conversation to economic
questions, which he said interested him most. He
expressed surprise that we had not come to state ownership
of railways, which he believed was the only way to
regulate them. I explained our method of regulating
them, but he thought that method more socialistic and
arbitrary than in his own country. We talked of the
Roosevelt policies and their general aim at social justice.
He said he regretted very much that Roosevelt had not
visited Roumania, for he had the greatest admiration for
him, both as man and as statesman.</p>

<p>Our conversation ran on to the Jewish question, and
the King spoke most sympathetically of the Jews, saying
that they were patriotic subjects and good soldiers, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
there was no religious prejudice against them, and that
the Jewish question in Roumania was purely economic.
The Jews who came in from Russia and Poland constituted
separate communities in the country, with foreign
methods of living, foreign language, and foreign
views. I told him that in the most enlightened countries
there was an absence of the Jewish problem because no
problem was created by treating the Jews as separate
groups with restricted rights. He saw that point, but
explained that Roumania was right next to Russia where
the Jews were most oppressed. If, therefore, Roumania
accorded them full rights, there would be a flood of immigration
much larger than they were then getting. I
pointed out that it would be much better to restrict immigration
than to restrict the natural rights of the Jews
of Roumania. That thought impressed him, and he said
he realized that, under the system they then had, much
injustice was done which brought disgrace to the kingdom,
but he hoped a remedy would be worked out.</p>

<p>We spoke of the United States Postal Savings legislation,
of which he requested an outline, and thought it
could be adopted by Roumania with advantage.</p>

<p>A few days later we again lunched with the King and
Queen. The Queen mentioned the bit of poetry I had
given her a few days before and asked whether I could
give her another. Something had been said about Hay's
Roumanian note that brought to mind the last stanza of
Hay's hymn:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Wherever man oppresses man,</span>
<span class="i1">Beneath the setting sun,</span>
<span class="i0">O Lord, be there, thine arm make bare,</span>
<span class="i1">Thy righteous will be done.</span>
</div>

<p>The Queen admired these lines and begged me to write
them out, which I did on the back of one of my visiting-cards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
She put the card in her reticule, saying that the
lines would inspire a poem some day, and that she would
then send it to me.</p>

<p>Referring to her work generally, she spoke of her indebtedness
to Professor Michael Bernays, the distinguished
Jewish scholar, who was a frequent and welcome
visitor at the home of her parents. She said he was the
most modest and intellectual person she had ever known,
and his conversations and teachings had greatly influenced
her intellectual and spiritual life. She asked me to
read her estimate of this wonderful man in her book of
essays that she had given me. I have since read it several
times, and it would surprise many to read such a eulogy
and vindication of the Jews and Judaism by the Queen
of a country where the Jews were so sorely oppressed by
drastic discrimination.</p>

<p>Before we left Sinaia, the Queen sent me a large photograph
of herself, inscribed: "Never mind deep waters,
there are pearls to be found. Elizabeth. Sinaia, September,
1910."</p>

<p>In Vienna, we were guests at a tea given by Dr. Sigmund
Münz, of "Die Neue Freie Presse." Among those
present was Baroness Bertha von Suttner, the great peace
advocate and authoress of "Down With Your Arms,"
who had received the Nobel Peace Prize the previous
year. I had met her before in the United States, where
we spoke from the same platform during the sessions
of the Interparliamentary Union and the International
Peace Societies.</p>

<p>Next we went to London, where we enjoyed the pleasant
hospitalities of our ambassador, Whitelaw Reid. At
one of the luncheons at the embassy I was pleased to make
the acquaintance of Dr. Luis M. Drago, the Argentine
international jurist and author of the Drago Doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
who had just returned from the Anglo-American Fisheries
Arbitration at The Hague.</p>

<p>We dined one evening with the Right Honorable Sir
Ernest Cassel at his charming home, Brooke House, and
afterward went with him to the theater. Sir Ernest, one
of England's leading financiers, was constantly being
referred to in the press in connection with the negotiations
pending in Paris for a new loan to the Turks. He
told us that these international financial negotiations,
because of their international importance, did not appeal
to him, for he had no ambition to be in the limelight or
to become a conspicuous international personage. He
preferred quiet and obscurity, for constant publicity disturbed
his peace of mind. This attitude was not one of
assumed modesty; he really said what he meant and felt.</p>

<p>On another evening we dined with Postmaster-General
Herbert Samuel and his wife. Mr. Samuel was only
thirty-nine years old and gave every promise of the distinction
which he has since attained in the service of his
country. At this writing he is British High Commissioner
in Palestine.</p>

<p>Lord Rothschild had written me to call on him when
in London; and I went to the banking house to see him.
In speaking of the Triple Entente of Great Britain,
France, and Russia, I told him I thought that, from a
British point of view, it was unwise. He, on the other
hand, regarded it as good because it offered the best
security for peace. A few days thereafter I mentioned
the subject to his brother, Alfred. The latter said that
he and his brother usually agreed, but in this matter they
took opposite views. Alfred considered it a great mistake,
from the point of view of civilization, for England to be
aligned with Russia, and beyond that he considered it
detrimental to the relationship between England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Germany, which was none too friendly. In the light of
all that has since taken place, it is interesting to note
how the international alignment of 1910 was reflected in
the minds of these big international financiers.</p>

<p>On September 8th we boarded the Lusitania at Liverpool,
reaching New York on the 13th. My brother Isidor
and our children met us, and we were made to appreciate
the real truth of the bull that "the greatest pleasure in
going abroad is returning home."</p>

<p>Soon afterward I went to Washington. First I called
at the State Department and had an informal talk with
Secretary Knox. I told him I did not wish to return to
Turkey. The important negotiations had been brought
to a favorable conclusion, and I felt that I had spent
enough of my time there. He referred to the understanding
with which I had accepted the post, that when I
desired to be relieved, another post that might be available
and acceptable to me would be tendered me. However,
I purposely did not comment on this understanding.
I simply said that I did not wish to cause the Administration
any embarrassment, and was content to stay at
home. He said he would have a talk with the President
and confer with me later.</p>

<p>When I called on the President, I told him that since
all the questions for which I went to Turkey had been adjusted,
I did not wish to return. Subsequently I received
a very cordial and complimentary letter from him, but,
as it contained no intimation of his earlier promise to
transfer me to a post more to my liking, I did not refer to
it. The rift between the Roosevelt policies and the Taft
Administration had by this time grown considerably,
and I was known to be in thorough accord with Roosevelt
and his policies.</p>

<p>In the torrential flood of American politics, two main
currents are continuously perceptible. There are, of
course, innumerable permanent and temporary cross-currents,
eddies, and other variations, but the two main
currents are ever present. One may be generally described
as professional, mechanical, and ruled by the
accomplished and consummate selfishness of invisible
forces. The other, while more genuine in spirit, is often
amateurish in effort; it is more spontaneous; it is kindled
by emotions of revolt; it sees mankind not as masses to be
exploited, and profited by, but as individuals to be set
freer to express themselves socially and economically. It
strives to restate the better aspirations of men generally,
and to mitigate some of the pressure that civilization
imposes upon them.</p>

<p>It is not the province of the historian to moralize. It
is his business to trace the changing currents of human
thought and to produce accurate pictures of men in
action. And so, in touching on the Progressives, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
endeavor to give some indication of the mental processes
that shaped their cause, and to depict some of the
dramatic scenes that carried their cause into action.
Many of these scenes I was able to observe closely. In
a sense, I may have figured more definitely than I realized
at the time, in kindling their cause into smoke and
flame.</p>

<p>On November 17, 1910, the New York Chamber of
Commerce held its one hundred and forty-second annual
banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The speakers
were Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts;
Governor Horace White, of New York; Mayor William
J. Gaynor, of New York City; and myself. The president
of the Chamber, the late A. Barton Hepburn, presided.
My subject was "American Prestige," and I could not
refrain from referring to the great extent to which American
influence and prestige had been advanced by Roosevelt,
both as President and during his tour through
Europe. There was instant and prolonged applause at
the mention of Roosevelt's name, clearly showing that
his political influence was not dead, contrary to the ideas
of many who thought so because the election of a few
days before had shown sweeping Democratic gains and
the defeat of Roosevelt's candidate for Governor, Henry
L. Stimson. When the banquet was over, Senator Lodge
said to me that if the political opponents of Roosevelt
could have seen the enthusiasm with which his name was
applauded, they would realize that even in New York he
was as much alive as ever.</p>

<p>When I had met Roosevelt in Cairo on his way back
from Africa, we had talked frequently about politics at
home. It was clear to me from his conversation that he
did not propose to be enticed or forced into accepting any
nomination, although there was talk, yes, I may say a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
demand, that he reënter public life as either Governor of
New York or United States Senator.</p>

<p>Roosevelt was so loyal a Republican that his opponents
constantly chided him for going along with the bosses,
like Senator Platt, for instance, and at the same time
advocating reforms. He used to reply that he did and
would continue to coöperate with the bosses so long as
they went his way. His aim from the time he entered
public life as a member of the New York State Assembly
was to make the party always more responsive to its
highest ideals; and from the beginning he worked against
the "invisible powers" or boss rule. By word and deed
all through his life he showed an independence and moral
courage that careless observers might often have mistaken
for headlong impetuosity. No one could know him without
recognizing that he was broad-minded, liberal, and
inherently progressive.</p>

<p>When he arrived home from abroad in June, 1910, he
found the Republican Party disrupted. The dissatisfaction
and impatience of the liberals was distinctly evident.
By 1912 Taft had allowed himself to become so thoroughly
identified with the reactionaries that the large
independent element had not only become unenthusiastic,
but decidedly hostile to the Administration. In his
Winona speech President Taft had ranked himself on the
side of those leaders in the party who opposed real tariff
reform. In his famous Norton letter he had even gone so
far as to imply, if not to expressly admit, that federal
Patronage had been used against the Progressives in
Congress.</p>

<p>The Progressive element both in and out of Congress
was therefore casting about for a candidate who represented
the liberal wing of the party, for nomination at the
National Republican Convention at Chicago in June.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Roosevelt's office at "The Outlook" was daily crowded
with liberal leaders who had come to consult with him
and to urge him to "throw his hat in the ring," to use one
of Roosevelt's own picturesque expressions. This demand
grew and spread until finally came the following appeal
from the Governors of the States of Kansas, Michigan,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, West Virginia, and
Wyoming:</p>

<blockquote><p>We feel that you will be unresponsive to a plain public duty
if you decline to accept the nomination coming as the voluntary
expression of the wishes of a majority of the Republican voters
of the United States through the action of their delegates in the
next National Convention.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this message Roosevelt replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the chief principles for which I have stood and for
which I now stand, and which I have always endeavoured and
always shall endeavour to reduce to action, is the genuine rule
of the people; and, therefore, I hope that so far as possible the
people may be given the chance, through direct primaries, to
express their preference as to who shall be the nominee of the
Republican Presidential Convention.</p></blockquote>

<p>During this period I called on Roosevelt one day at the
offices of "The Outlook," and he handed me the galley-proof
of a speech he was to make before the Constitutional
Convention at Columbus, Ohio. He called it "The
Charter of Democracy." His room was full of callers, so
I went into Dr. Abbott's office and there carefully read
the speech. In it Roosevelt advocated, among other
reforms such as the short ballot and the initiative and
referendum, the recall of judicial decisions. When I came
to that subject I confess I was shocked, and so expressed
myself to one of the editors of "The Outlook"; as I
remember it, it was Dr. Abbott himself. Compelled to
keep another appointment, I left the office when I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
finished reading the speech, saying that I should return
later.</p>

<p>Upon my return I met Roosevelt just as he was going
out to keep an engagement.</p>

<p>"I hear you don't like my speech," he said to me.</p>

<p>"I like your speech; I think it is fine; all but that portion
of it which refers to the recall of judicial decisions,"
I answered. I started to give my reasons, but seeing that
he was pressed for time, I said: "I should like to discuss
that matter with you, provided your mind is open on the
subject." To my great surprise he said that he had
thought the subject over very carefully, and frankly told
me that he had come to a definite decision on it.</p>

<p>That was so unlike the Roosevelt I knew in the many
discussions I had had with him, when invariably I found
his mind responsive, that I was quite disappointed and
somewhat taken back. But I did not want him to feel
that I had joined the ranks of the many who had parted
political company with him because he had made it
known that he would accept another nomination for
President, and so, on reaching my office, I wrote him a
letter, briefly explaining why I objected to his statements
regarding the recall of judicial decisions. I assured him
that on that account I did not part from him politically,
for after all I agreed with him more than with any other
candidate who might possibly be named.</p>

<p>The birth and development of the Progressive Party
is, of course, an element of national history that has often
been detailed. William Draper Lewis, in his "Life of
Theodore Roosevelt," and Lawrence F. Abbott, in his
"Impressions of Theodore Roosevelt," both give clear
accounts of it. Roosevelt's candidacy and defeat have
been variously analyzed, but I believe now, as I believed
in 1912, that but for this unfortunate statement regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
judicial decisions, Roosevelt would have been re-elected
President in 1912. It is true that he afterwards
clarified the meaning of his use of the word "recall";
that its application was limited to such decisions as held
legislative acts unconstitutional, and that such decisions
might at the following election be submitted to popular
vote, in accordance with the method employed by a
State for the adoption of its constitution. But his clarification
never overcame the effects of the Columbus
speech. William Draper Lewis, who was one of Roosevelt's
closest advisers at the time, says in his biography:</p>

<blockquote><p>Looking back now over the events leading up to the Republican
National Convention of 1912, it would appear almost
certain that had he, in his address before the Ohio Convention,
either refrained from making the proposal or had he called it
a new method of amending the constitution, and carefully
explained it so that it could not have been misunderstood, it is
most probable that he would have been nominated at Chicago,
and that the whole course of the recent history of the United
States would have been other than it has been.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Shortly after the Columbus speech, Roosevelt delivered,
on March 20, 1912, at Carnegie Hall, New York,
what was in many respects the most forceful and eloquent
address I ever heard him make. He graphically
described his dedication to his ideals of democracy:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our task as Americans is to strive for social and industrial
justice, achieved through the genuine rule of the people. This
is our end, our purpose. The methods for achieving the end are
merely expedients, to be finally accepted or rejected according
as actual experience shows that they work well or ill. But in
our hearts we must have this lofty purpose, and we must strive
for it in all earnestness and sincerity, or our work will come
to nothing. In order to succeed, we need leaders of inspired
idealism, leaders to whom are granted great visions, who dream
greatly and strive to make their dreams come true; who can
kindle the people with the fire from their own burning souls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>The leader for the time being, whoever he may be, is but an
instrument, to be used until broken and then to be cast aside;
and if he is worth his salt, he will care no more when he is broken
than a soldier cares when he is sent where his life is forfeit in
order that the victory may be won.</p>

<p>If on this new continent we merely build another country of
great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have
done nothing; and we shall do as little if we merely set the greed
of envy against the greed of arrogance, and thereby destroy
the material well-being of all of us. To turn this government
into government by plutocracy or government by a mob would
be to repeat on a larger scale the lamentable failures of the
world that is dead. We stand against all tyranny, by the few
or by the many. We stand for the rule of the many in the
interest of all of us, for the rule of the many in the spirit of
courage, of common sense, of high purpose, above all, in a spirit
of kindly justice towards every man and every woman.</p></blockquote>

<p>A month after the meeting of the National Convention
of the Progressive Party, popularly called the "Bull
Moose Convention," which nominated Theodore Roosevelt
for President and Hiram W. Johnson for Vice-President,
the New York State Convention of the Progressive
Party met at Syracuse, in the Arena. The convention
met on September 5th.</p>

<p>All during the first day and night, amid lively discussion
as to the selection of candidates for Governor,
committees urged me for permission to present my name
as a candidate; but I steadfastly declined, since the governorship,
being so largely a political office, did not appeal
to me. I was neither by training nor by temperament a
politician, although I had taken active part in campaigns
for many years, both local and national. The next day I
was asked to take the permanent chairmanship of the
convention. This I was willing and glad to do; I wanted
to be of service to the party; also it was a foregone conclusion
that acceptance of the chairmanship would preclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
my being considered a candidate for the nomination
for Governor.</p>

<p>The Arena was filled with about seven thousand delegates
and members of the new Progressive Party. The
air was surcharged with the spirit of the new movement&mdash;the
genuine enthusiasm of men and women of character
and standing from every county in the State, and
among them a great many ministers, professors, reformers,
and leaders of benevolent and charitable movements.
There was a conspicuous absence of the professional
politician. Indeed, that convention had more the
character of a town meeting than of a cut-and-dried political
convention. Instead of having decisions made for
them, this great body of enthusiasts were called upon to
make their own. The candidates had not even been
agreed upon.</p>

<p>On September 6th I took my gavel in hand and called
the meeting to order. The first business before the convention
was the nomination of a candidate for Governor.
The secretary called the counties of the State in alphabetical
order, and the chairman of each delegation made
his nomination. The outstanding candidates for nomination
were William H. Hotchkiss, one of the organizers
of the Progressive Party and chairman of the National
Committee, and William A. Prendergast, comptroller of
the City of New York, who had made the speech nominating
Roosevelt for President at the Chicago Convention.
A deadlock between these two candidates ensued.</p>

<p>After Yates County had been heard from, a tall, gaunt
young man towered to his feet and asked to be heard; he
was from the Fifteenth Manhattan District, and he had
a nomination to make. It was not quite in order, though
the spirit of the convention was to give each man a
chance. While I was hesitating about recognizing him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
there seemed to be a general desire that he be given an
opportunity to speak, so I gave him five minutes.</p>

<p>He looked fantastic as he strode to the platform and
faced the audience. His manner was somewhat bizarre.
He burst forth in dramatic fashion as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen: I have just come down
from Vermont. I ask you people at this convention to make
no mistake.</p>

<p>We want to put a man up for Governor that no man will be
afraid to cast his vote for, against whom there can be no charge
leveled of misconduct of any kind, one who can sweep the
State from Montauk Point to Lake Erie, and carry every man
of every race, religion, and creed; a man whose name is known
throughout the civilized world; a man the mention of whose
name brings a tear of sympathy to the eye of almost every man
and woman in the civilized land; a man whose name, wherever
men are found with red blood in their veins, irrespective of
race, religion, and creed, will be carried thundering throughout
the State to victory.</p>

<p>There is no chance for defeat with this man at the head of the
ticket&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>"Who is your candidate?" cried impatient listeners.</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Name your candidate!"</p>

<p>In sudden answer to these cries from the convention,
the speaker exclaimed:</p>

<blockquote><p>I nominate the illustrious and honorable Oscar S. Straus.</p></blockquote>

<p>During the long, terrific applause that followed, the
delegate stood awkwardly waiting for a chance to finish.
Finally he went on:</p>

<blockquote><p>We should take no chances in this fight. I could not say one
undeserved word if I used the entire dictionary in praise of
the other nominees, Mr. Hotchkiss and Mr. Prendergast; but,
gentlemen, Mr. Prendergast or Mr. Hotchkiss would cause
friction in the State. We want no friction in this election. We
want success and victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>Gentlemen, there is not a newspaper editor in the State of
New York that would any more assassinate the character of
Oscar S. Straus than he would assassinate the character of his
own mother.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, remember! Remember that Rome was saved by
the cackle of geese. I have no political prestige, but I warn
and charge you, put up a man for candidate for governor who
cannot and will not be defeated.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, gentlemen, heed me! Make no mistake about
Oscar S. Straus. You will make no mistake in putting him up as
your candidate, and you will capture victory and success. No
man has had better distinction at home and abroad than Mr.
Straus. I ask you to vote for him.</p></blockquote>

<p>The moment he finished, a stampede started. The entire
hall assumed the aspect of a good-natured bedlam.
There was cheering and applause, and many of the delegates
began marching round that big auditorium, brandishing
the banners of their counties, singing "The Battle
Hymn of the Republic" and "Onward, Christian Soldiers,"
and breaking out in the end with "Straus! Straus!
We want Straus!"</p>

<p>I pounded the desk with the gavel, I shook my head
in the negative, but to no avail. The noise lasted fully
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The picturesque young man who had precipitated this
scene was John G. McGee, known among his colleagues
as "Suspender Jack." He had been a member of the
mounted police of New York City.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Hotchkiss and several other leaders
came to the platform and insisted upon my accepting.
They even brought Mrs. Straus up with the hope of getting
her to exert her persuasive powers. There was no alternative;
I had to accept.</p>

<p>Mr. Hotchkiss announced my acceptance, and immediately
former Lieutenant-Governor Timothy L.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Woodruff announced the withdrawal of Mr. Prendergast
and moved to make the nomination unanimous by acclamation.
That produced more shouting and cheering,
accompanied by much applause and the waving of banners.
It was a touching manifestation and an unexpected
honor. I made a brief speech of acceptance, during which
I found it difficult to hide the effect of all this demonstration.
And with more applause and cheering, the session
closed with the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>The next morning the convention named for Lieutenant-Governor
Frederick M. Davenport, who was Professor
of Law and Politics at Hamilton College and had
made an admirable record in the State Legislature. The
ticket was then quickly completed and the convention
closed.</p>

<p>The nominations were received with great favor all
through the State and in the press. Roosevelt at the time
was in the Far West conducting his own campaign, and
wrote me from Spokane as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<span class="smcap">The Spokane</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Spokane, Washington</span><br />
<i>September</i> 8, 1912
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>When I left New York I had expected Prendergast to be
nominated and there were certain reasons, which I think you
know, why I felt that, as a matter of principle, his nomination
should be made.</p>

<p>But there was a still further principle involved, and that was
that in this Convention the people should have their own way;
and, upon my word, I am inclined to think that it was a new
illustration of the fact that the wisdom of <i>all</i> of us is better
than the wisdom of any of us. Having in view the effect, not
only in New York but the country at large, I think that your
nomination stands second only to that of Hiram Johnson as
Vice-President, from the standpoint of strengthening the
ticket. If the only result of the next election were to place you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in as Governor of New York, I should be inclined to think that
the Progressive Party had justified itself.</p>

<p>My dear fellow, I am overjoyed; I congratulate you with all
my heart. Give my love to dear Mrs. Straus and to Roger and
your two daughters and all the grandchildren.</p>

<div class="signature2">
Ever yours</div>
<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>A few days thereafter he gave out the following interview:</p>

<blockquote><p>Next in importance to the nomination of the Vice-President
is the nomination for Governor of New York. And it seems to
me that Hiram Johnson and Oscar Straus symbolize what this
movement stands for. One is an ex-Republican, the other an
ex-Democrat; they both stand for what is highest in American
citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. Straus is not merely a high-minded and able man, a man
of incorruptible integrity and great ability, but also a man who
has kept abreast of the great movement from which sprang
the Progressive Party. He is eminently fitted to be one of the
leaders in this movement. On every point of our platform he
represents an intense earnestness of conviction for all the
things for which we stand. His attitude toward business, his
attitude toward the complicated, and the vitally important
social and economic problems which are dealt with in our plank
concerning social and industrial justice; in short, his whole position
on governmental matters has been such as to warrant our
saying that he is already in practice applying the very principles
which we preach.</p>

<p>New York State has a right to be proud of the fact that in
this first State Convention of the people themselves Mr.
Straus's nomination was, in the most emphatic sense, a nomination
by the people themselves, a nomination representing the
desire of the people to have the very best man take the office,
although that man was himself sincerely desirous to escape
having to take it.</p>

<p>I have known Mr. Straus intimately ever since I was Governor
of New York. When he was in my Cabinet I leaned much
upon him, and a more loyal and disinterested friend no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
could have, and, what is more important, no man could have
a more loyal, disinterested, and sanely zealous supporter. As
head of the Department of Commerce and Labor Mr. Straus
himself, by study and administration of the law, was one of
those who reached conclusions as to the needs of our handling
of the anti-trust and interstate commerce and similar laws,
which I set forth in message after message to Congress, and
which were substantially embodied in the Progressive platform;
and in his attitude toward labor, toward immigration, toward
the duty both of public and private employees, he foreshadowed
that part of the Progressive platform which has dealt
with these same matters.</p>

<p>Moreover, by his disinterestedness, his unselfish devotion to
the cause of good government and of sound progressive doctrine
for economic and social reform, and by his willingness
personally to sacrifice his own interests to those of the cause he
espouses, he is, I am happy to say, typical of all men who are
in the new movement.</p>

<p>Exactly as it is a real sacrifice for Hiram Johnson to accept
the nomination for Vice-President, so it is a real sacrifice for
Oscar Straus to accept the nomination for Governor of New
York. Each has accepted because he is not thinking of himself.
He is thinking of his duty to the people as a whole; of his duty
to the great Nation to which he belongs. Oscar Straus's nomination
is not only a most fortunate thing for the New York
Progressives, but it is also a piece of real good fortune for the
Progressive movement throughout this Nation.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the Republicans had their convention at Saratoga
a short while after my nomination at Syracuse,
several of their prominent State leaders telegraphed me
to inquire whether I would accept the Republican nomination.
They feared that with three candidates in the
field the State would go Democratic. One of my managers
favored my acceptance, which would without doubt have
meant election. But my chief adviser, Chairman Hotchkiss,
agreed with me that my accepting the Republican
nomination, without the endorsement by the Republicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of the Progressive platform, would destroy the Progressive
Party in the State, if not throughout the country.
I therefore sent an immediate reply that while I should
welcome the support of any group or party that chose to
give it, I could not accept a nomination that did not mean
an endorsement and acceptance of the platform on which
I stood. On hearing of this, Roosevelt telegraphed me
from Memphis: "Three cheers for you. You are a perfect
trump and you always do the right thing."</p>

<p>The Republican candidate was Job E. Hedges, a brilliant
member of the New York Bar. The Democrats
nominated William Sulzer, and Tammany Hall sanctioned
the selection because he was considered a good
opponent who would attract the Jewish vote. But our
politicians make no greater mistake than to believe that
there is such a thing as a Jewish group vote. Of course, a
candidate who by word or action has shown prejudice
against or hostility toward the Jews could not expect their
suffrage; but beyond that the Jews are not controllable
as a group at the polls. However, as chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House, Sulzer had
taken a prominent part in the abrogation of our treaty
with Russia, and during the campaign the slogan, "non-Jewish
but pro-Jewish," was designed to bring him the
support of the mass of Jewish voters in addition to the
regular Democratic vote.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the whole the campaign was conducted with dignity
on all sides. There was a noticeable absence of vilification
of candidates and general mud-slinging between the
camps, as is too often the case in keenly contested elections.
My campaign managers arranged for me to make
addresses in every county and almost every city throughout
the State. I had a special car in which traveled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
besides Mr. Davenport, my wife and me, and several
other speakers, a dozen or more reporters from the leading
papers.</p>

<p>I made my first speech in Getty Square, Yonkers, and
from there I traveled for seven weeks, making ten to
fifteen speeches every day except Sundays, including
short talks at stations and from the rear platform of my
car. Sometimes I made speeches before breakfast, to
crowds that had gathered at the station, and there were
always two or three, and often more, formal addresses a
day in some public hall, to which I would be escorted
from the train with a band of music, and sometimes with
a fife and drum corps, invariably playing "Onward,
Christian Soldiers." So many clergymen took part in the
campaign that frequently the meetings were opened with
a prayer. Many of the meetings were spontaneous, emphasizing
the crusading spirit which was so characteristic
of the campaign.</p>

<p>One of my slogans was that I was the "unbossed candidate
of the unbossed people." One day up in the northern
part of the State I was speaking on a raised platform in
the open, and, as usual, my time was limited by the train
schedule. A member of the committee told my wife, who
was sitting behind me, that the train would leave in a
few minutes, and that it was time for me to stop, and just
as I got to the middle of the phrase, "unbossed candidate&mdash;"
she pulled my coat-tail as a signal for me to stop.
At that moment I was quite evidently not the "unbossed
candidate" that I professed to be, and the audience
laughed and cheered with amusement. I think that
bit of bossing, however, did not cost me any votes.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport proved himself a most effective campaign
speaker. Another effective orator in our party for
a short time was Bainbridge Colby, who discharged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
great distinction the important duties of Secretary of
State during the last year of the Wilson Administration.
At Oneonta and at one or two other places, while I was
taking a much-needed rest, the crowds had gathered and
were calling for me. Mr. Colby, without being introduced,
responded for me, and the audiences were left with
the impression that they had listened to me. My cause
certainly did not suffer by my being so admirably represented,
or perhaps I should say advantageously misrepresented.</p>

<p>Roosevelt in the meantime had flung himself into the
campaign with all the force of his tremendous vigor and
energy, and gave to it a dynamic impulse that grew in
intensity as he progressed through the country. He went
out to the Pacific Coast, returned through the Southern
States to New York City, speaking at every important
center. In September he went through New England.
In October he started on his final tour through the
Middle West, and it was while on this trip that he was
shot by a lunatic just as he was leaving his hotel to make
a speech in the Auditorium in Milwaukee. The incident,
tragic in itself, was made dramatic by his heroism. With
the bullet in his breast and his clothes soaked with blood,
disregarding the entreaties of his companions, he went
on to the Auditorium and spoke for more than an hour.
To him nothing counted except the triumph of the principles
for which he was fighting.</p>

<p>In consequence of this accident the national managers
had me leave the State of New York and take up the
national campaign, which I did cheerfully. No one, of
course, could fill Roosevelt's engagements, but the plan
was to rescue the cause so far as possible, and I spoke in
several of the larger cities where meetings had been
scheduled for Roosevelt, principally Chicago, Cincinnati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and Cleveland. My intense anxiety regarding the condition
of my chief during this time was greatly relieved by
assuring telegrams from Mrs. Roosevelt and his nephew,
George Emlen Roosevelt, who were both at his side.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Two final rallies were arranged in Madison Square
Garden, New York&mdash;one on Wednesday, October 30th,
for the national ticket, and the second on Friday, November
1st, for the State ticket. Roosevelt, though not well,
considered himself sufficiently recovered to appear. His
physicians, Doctors Lambert and Brewer, had prescribed
no more campaign speeches, in fact, did not want him to
go to these meetings; but he brushed aside their injunctions
and left Oyster Bay for Madison Square.</p>

<p>His presence at the national rally was his first public
appearance since the shooting, and keyed-up the meeting
to a high dramatic pitch. Fully eighteen thousand persons
were in the auditorium and a few thousand more
were outside clamoring for admission. When Roosevelt
appeared on the platform, a roar of applause broke loose
and continued for forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Roosevelt's speech, characteristically, was confined to
a plea for the Progressive cause and for the State ticket;
no word for himself. He appeared in good form and to
possess his usual vigor, although it was observed that he
did not use his right arm. His speech was earnest, calm,
and exalted, closing with what he called his political
creed:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am glad beyond measure that I am one of the many who
in this fight have stood ready to spend and be spent, pledged
to fight while life lasts the great fight for righteousness and for
brotherhood and for the welfare of mankind.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the rally for the State ticket two nights later the
crowd inside the Garden was as large as at the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
rally, though there were fewer people outside. The enthusiasm
was at the same high pitch. When I arose to
speak, the cheering began and lasted twenty-seven minutes
before it could be checked. Roosevelt was expected
during the evening. His physicians had reminded him
when he started from home that he had promised not to
speak any more in the campaign, to which he humorously
replied that he had promised not to speak for himself,
but that this time he would talk for Oscar Straus and
Fred Davenport and the candidates on the judiciary
ticket!</p>

<p>At the close of my thirty-minute address, Roosevelt
appeared. The crowd went wild, and stopped cheering
only when Mr. Hotchkiss, who was presiding, besought
them to stop out of consideration for the Colonel. Roosevelt
spoke for an hour and held that vast audience in
rapt attention. He devoted the first half of his speech to
outlining the Progressive cause, its meaning and purpose,
and the second half to advocating the State ticket. He
referred to my public career in terms of unmeasured
praise, beginning with my first mission to Turkey. He
told the crowd that everywhere he spoke, from the Great
Lakes to the Gulf and from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
he had "found that the name of Oscar Straus was a name
with which to conjure," and that it "helped the Progressive
cause in California and in New Mexico, in Illinois
and in Kansas, that we here in New York had
named such a man as our candidate for Governor." He
then gave accounts of the personal services and qualifications
of the other members of the ticket, and with this
meeting the Progressive campaign of 1912 closed with a
blaze of unforgettable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On election day I received the following letter from
Roosevelt:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<span class="smcap">Oyster Bay</span><br />
<i>November</i> 5, 1912
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Oscar</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I count myself fortunate in having run upon the same ticket
with you and in having had the privilege of supporting you.
You are the kind of American who makes one proud of being
an American; and I wish also to say that I feel just the same
way about all your family, your dear wife, your two daughters
and son. It is just such a family, and just such a family life,
as I like to think of as typical of our citizenship at its best.</p>

<p>
With affectionate regard and esteem
</p>
<p class="center">Faithfully yours</p>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The Progressives, as might have been expected, had
been poorly organized. The time had been too short for
intensive development of our forces. We had no machine,
and in a number of the counties there was scarcely a
skeleton of an organization. It was, in fact, not a party
in the ordinary sense of the word at all, but rather a
crusade, and what we lacked in organization we made
up by an abundance of spontaneous ardor. We did not
really expect victory, although Roosevelt several times
said that while he knew he would be defeated, he thought
I would be elected. As a matter of fact, I believe I was
the only candidate of the Progressive cause for Governor
in any State who ran ahead of Roosevelt. In New York
State he got 389,000 votes, in round numbers, while I had
393,000.</p>

<p>I knew from observations during my campaign from
one end of the State to the other, how poorly, from a
political standpoint, the Progressives were organized,
and I confess I did not see the slightest chance of being
elected. I was not disappointed, and I think that the
men generally who ran for offices on the Progressive
ticket were not disappointed. They realized that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
contest was waged for a cause and not for office, and from
an educational point of view the campaign was eminently
successful.</p>

<p>Considering the vastness of the undertaking and the
shortness of the time, we did as well as any of us could
have anticipated, if not better. We were confident that
the cause would triumph, in a degree at least, no matter
what party was in power, and I think the facts amply
justify our belief that the Progressive ideals made a
definite impression upon the country, and have given
strength, if not dominant influence, to Progressive principles
in both of the old parties.</p>

<p>The ominous clouds, visible from time to time on the
diplomatic horizon during my last mission to Turkey,
had latterly expanded from only local significance into
implications of greater and more sinister magnitude. It
had accordingly grown more and more apparent to me
that the tinder box of Europe, the Eastern Question, was
likely to burst into flames at almost any moment; and,
in common with other close observers, I was not unaware
of an inscrutable and widespread tension in the international
air.</p>

<p>It seemed to many of us that America, which had so
long remained wrapped rather complacently in its cloak
of isolation, might have a stern duty to perform, not only
to itself, but to the rest of the world. That duty seemed
to us to involve the immediate need of a more vigorous
promotion of world peace and of the specific and definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
designing and constructing of a proper machinery of
enforcement.</p>

<p>In 1899, and again in 1907, to be sure, we had taken a
leading part in the two Hague Peace Conferences, at the
first of which twenty-six, and in the second of which forty-four,
nations participated. These nations had signed and
ratified the various treaties formulated by the two conferences.
The first conference was called by the Emperor
of Russia. Its main purpose, as stated in the Russian
note proposing the conference, was by means of international
discussion and agreement to provide the most
effective means for ensuring to all peoples the benefits of
a real and lasting peace, and, above all, to limit the progressive
development of armaments.</p>

<p>Soon after the conference assembled, it was found that
no agreement could be reached respecting the limitation
of armaments, whereupon the attention of the delegates
was chiefly directed to formulating plans for the peaceful
settlement of international disputes. This resulted in the
adoption of a treaty of arbitration entitled: "Convention
for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes."
The American, the British, and the delegates of several
other leading Powers favored an agreement for compulsory
arbitration of all matters of a juridical nature; but
this was opposed at the first conference by Germany,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and again at the second conference. The treaty, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in a modified and purely optional form, was adopted,
though it fell short, by reason of Germany's opposition,
of much that it was hoped to attain; yet it was a distinct
gain in providing definite machinery for the maintenance
of peace and the adjustment of international differences
by peaceful means.</p>

<p>In the development of international relations, in case
of the threat of war or of actual war, it was regarded as
an unfriendly act for outside Powers to tender good
offices or to mediate in the cause of peace. This unfortunate
and unrighteous condition was radically changed
and indeed reversed by the treaty; the signatories agreed
not only to have recourse to the good offices or mediation
of friendly Powers, but agreed also that such Powers
should on their own initiative tender such good offices to
the States at variance, and that such overtures should
never be regarded as an unfriendly act by either of the
parties in dispute. Especially in our country and in Great
Britain, these treaties awakened anew the spirit of international
justice and good-will, and there ensued many
meetings designed to inform and stimulate popular interest
in the cause of world peace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>John W. Foster, former Secretary of State, who had been
in New York a short time before as a member of a committee
to provide for a public meeting urging the ratification
of the arbitration treaties, had made an appointment
for me to meet Secretary Hay for a conference regarding
them. I met Mr. Foster at the Cosmos Club
and went with him to meet Mr. Hay at the latter's residence.
Hay, as usual, met us in his gracious way and we
discussed the subject from all sides. My main concern
was that these little arbitration treaties, which excepted
questions of "vital interest and national honor," should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
not have the effect of abridging the broader provisions of
the Hague Treaty. I had brought with me a draft of a
treaty which guarded against such contingencies, with
which Mr. Foster seemed to be in agreement.</p>

<p>Hay said he fully caught my idea, but that it had been
desired to make all of these treaties alike and to conform
with the one between France and Great Britain. He said
it would be difficult enough, as it was, to get these treaties
through the Senate, as there was considerable opposition,
and therefore it was advisable to have these treaties with
the several Powers identical; otherwise separate arguments
would be made against each of the treaties. The
Secretary asked me, however, to leave with him the draft
I had prepared, saying that it might prove very useful to
him.</p>

<p>The final upshot was that these treaties, to which Hay
had devoted so much care and thought during his last
months in Washington, and by which he hoped to lessen
the likelihood of war throughout the world, were violently
opposed in the Senate on the ground that they deprived
it of its constitutional rights. Senators Knox and Spooner
and their followers took the view that every separate
agreement to arbitrate under these treaties must be submitted
to the Senate. An amendment to this effect
emasculated the main purposes of the treaty and left the
subject of arbitration substantially as it would be without
any treaties. As Hay stated, Roosevelt saw the situation
plainly enough and decided not to submit the treaties for
ratification by the other Powers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On my return home from Turkey, the New York Peace
Society, of which I had been the president until I entered
the Cabinet in 1906, and whose membership and activities
had been very much enlarged under my successor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Andrew Carnegie, gave me a reception on January 7,
1910, at the Hotel Plaza, in New York. Mr. Carnegie,
who was earnestly and intensely devoted to the cause of
international peace, and who had donated the necessary
money for the construction of the Peace Palace at The
Hague, presided at this reception, and made one of his
characteristic addresses. The subject of my talk was
"The Threatening Clouds of War," as they appeared to
me to be gathering in the Near East and in the Balkans.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the most timely public service
I could possibly render during this period was to help
arouse public opinion to a sense of the imperative need of
a newer view of world relations, and a genuine public
demand for an international understanding and machinery
with which peace might be maintained.</p>

<p>"World Peace" was therefore my subject when, on
April 13th of the same year, the Authors' Club tendered
me a dinner "in recognition of my public services at home
and abroad." It was presided over by the veteran author
and publisher, Henry Holt, who nominated Mr. Carnegie
as toastmaster. Speeches were made by our ambassador
to Berlin, David Jayne Hill, by Rev. Dr. Thomas R.
Slicer, Edward M. Shepard, Professor William P. Trent,
of Columbia University, and several others.</p>

<p>Though the Authors' Club has a comparatively small
membership, limited to members of the craft, yet there
have sprung from its ranks a number of our most eminent
diplomatists, such as John Hay, Andrew D. White,
General Horace Porter, David Jayne Hill, Dr. Henry
van Dyke, Seth Low, and Frederick W. Holls. The last
two were delegates to the First Hague Peace Conference.</p>

<p>Determined to make the most of the growing popular
agitation for the promotion of international arbitration
and peace, Mr. Carnegie soon afterwards organized a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
great peace meeting which was held in Carnegie Hall,
New York City. The big hall was packed from pit to
dome, and thousands were unable to gain admission.
The meeting was opened by Mr. Carnegie, as presiding
officer, and he was followed by Baron d'Estournelles de
Constant. In my address I specially emphasized neutral
duties in time of war and the inhibition upon neutrals to
lend money to belligerents pending war as being quite as
much an unneutral act as the selling of ships of war and
armaments, as had been usually the case in the past when
money thus borrowed was used for that very purpose.</p>

<p>During the years 1903, 1904, and 1905, I devoted much
attention to questions affecting international relations.
I was invited by Admiral Chadwick, president of the
United States Naval War College at Newport, to deliver
several lectures during the summer of 1903, and took for
my subject the protection of our citizens abroad, and
surveyed the entire subject of citizenship, native-born
and naturalized. I pointed out that by the law of July
27, 1868, it was specifically provided that naturalized
citizens while in foreign states shall receive from our
Government the same protection as to their persons and
property that is accorded to native-born citizens in like
circumstances. All the European countries denied the
right of expatriation, while America from the beginning
had insisted upon that right as one of its basic elements
of liberty.</p>

<p>In several notable instances, our Navy had taken
prompt action to uphold American rights. One such
case was that of Martin Coszta, a Hungarian insurgent
in the revolution of 1848-49, who escaped to Turkey and
from there came to the United States and made the
usual declaration preparatory to being naturalized under
our laws. He returned to Turkey in 1854, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Smyrna he was seized while on shore and taken up by
the crew of an Austrian frigate and put in irons. Before
the boat got under way, an American frigate arrived
and threatened to sink the Austrian vessel unless
Coszta was released. This led to an agreement under
which he was put in the custody of the French consul-general.</p>

<p>It is of the highest importance that the men of our
Navy, especially those in command of ships, should be
conversant with the principles of international law, as
they are frequently called upon to act promptly. This conflict
of sovereignty respecting naturalized citizens caused
the war between us and Great Britain in 1812. Beginning
with 1868, we concluded treaties of naturalization with
the German States and Austria-Hungary, and subsequently
with most of the other States.</p>

<p>My address was subsequently published in the quarterly
proceedings of the College of March, 1904. The
following year I delivered another address before the
College on international relations specifically with reference
to Russia and the United States. This address was
likewise published in the proceedings of the Naval War
College, and with some modifications appeared in the
"North American Review" of August, 1905.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>For a number of years many of the leading men of the
country who were interested in international relations
were annually, at the beginning of the summer, the guests
of Messrs. Smiley at their noted hotel at Lake Mohonk.
These gatherings were known as the Lake Mohonk Conferences
on International Arbitration, lasted several days,
and addresses were made upon various international
subjects.</p>

<p>At the conference of 1905, it occurred to some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
members who were in attendance, who had long entertained
the idea that an American society devoted exclusively
to the interests of international law should be
formed, that, in view of the large attendance that year of
many prominent men interested in the subject, it would
be a propitious time to organize. James Brown Scott,
Professor of International Law at Columbia University,
and Professor George W. Kirchwey, Dean of the Law
School of the University, were most active in promoting
the idea. A preliminary meeting was called, and about
fifty of the gentlemen in attendance at the conference
took part. They elected me as chairman, Professor James
Brown Scott as secretary, and appointed a committee of
twenty-one to effect a permanent organization. The committee
so appointed consisted of the following: Chandler
P. Anderson, James B. Angell, Professor Joseph H. Beale,
Jr., David J. Brewer, Charles Henry Butler, J. M. Dickinson,
John W. Foster, George Gray, Professor Charles
Noble Gregory, John W. Griggs, Professor George W.
Kirchwey, Robert Lansing, Professor John Bassett
Moore, W. W. Morrow, Professor Leo S. Rowe, Professor
James B. Scott, Oscar S. Straus, Everett P. Wheeler,
Andrew D. White, Professor George G. Wilson, and
Theodore S. Woolsey.</p>

<p>The American Society of International Law was formally
organized on January 12, 1906. Back of its founding
was the firm belief that the influence of an association
of publicists and others, organized along the lines indicated,
would count for much in the formation of a sound
and rational body of doctrine concerning the true principles
of international relations.</p>

<p>The following editorial comment regarding this organization
is quoted from the January, 1907, issue of "The
American Journal of International Law":</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>While the necessity of such a society was felt by many, no
serious steps were taken until the summer of 1905. It occurred
to some of the members of the Mohonk Lake conference on
international arbitration, that a society devoted exclusively to
the interests of international law as distinct from international
arbitration might be formed and that the members of the
Mohonk Conference would supply a nucleus membership. Accordingly
a call was issued to the members present at the conference,
and as the result of the call and meeting of those interested
a committee was appointed with Oscar S. Straus as chairman
and James B. Scott as secretary, to consider plans for a
definite organization and for the publication of a journal exclusively
devoted to international law as the organ of the Society.
On December 9th, 1905, a meeting of the committee was held
at the residence of Oscar S. Straus in New York City, and as
the result of favorable reports of the members present it appeared
feasible to proceed immediately to the definitive organization
of the Society. Accordingly a call was issued by the chairman
for a meeting of those interested in international law and
its popularization, to be held at the New York Bar Association,
on Friday, January 12th, 1906.</p>

<p>At this meeting it was decided to organize upon a permanent
basis a society of those interested in the spread of international
law with its ideals of justice and therefore of peace; a constitution
was adopted; officers were elected and the Society took its
place, it is hoped, permanently among the learned and influential
societies of the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>On April 19 and 20, 1907, was held the first annual
meeting of the American Society of International Law,
at Washington, which was attended by an unexpectedly
large number of members. The society had grown, in the
short time since its organization, to a membership of over
five hundred. The various sessions were devoted to discussions
of international topics, and closed with a banquet
presided over by Secretary Root, and addresses were
made by several speakers, including two former Secretaries
of State, namely, Richard Olney and John W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Foster, as well as by James Bryce, General Horace Porter,
and the writer.</p>

<p>To-day the society has more than twelve hundred
members, and since 1907 it has regularly held annual
meetings and issued its quarterly publication, "The
American Journal of International Law." Since the
beginning, Elihu Root has been the president, with whom
are associated as vice-presidents and members of the
executive council more than forty of the leading writers
and authorities, Senators and judges, including the Chief
Justice of the United States. I still am the chairman of
the executive committee, of which Professor Scott has
from the beginning been the recording secretary, as well
as the editor-in-chief of the "Journal." An analytical
index of the fourteen volumes of the "Journal" (1907-20)
has recently been prepared by George A. Finch,
secretary of the board of editors.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>While these various groups were pressing forward on
their respective avenues of approach to a better understanding
between nations, President Roosevelt was applying
his energies to the problem in his own way. His
method was in this instance characterized by a strikingly
objective and dramatic treatment. He firmly believed
that the greater power a peaceful nation has to make war
in a world threatened by war, the greater becomes its
power to command peace. The peace societies will not
endorse this contention; but the history of international
relations gives force to that proposition. Such are international
amenities, paradoxical as it may appear.</p>

<p>Roosevelt's terse message to a world threatened by war
was to send a great fleet of battleships on a voyage round
the world.</p>

<p>The fleet was scheduled to return to Hampton Roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
on Washington's birthday, February 22, 1908. It was to
be reviewed on its arrival by the President. Admiral
Adolph Marix, the chairman of the Lighthouse Board in
my Department, in the tender Maple took my wife and
me, Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Hockstader, my son-in-law
and daughter, and several officials of the Department
to Hampton Roads, and we steamed out to the tail of the
Horse Shoe some ten miles from Old Point Comfort. At
the appointed time, eleven o'clock that day, Admiral
Sperry in his flagship Connecticut passed in review before
the President, and following him came the twenty-four
battleships consisting of the sixteen ships that went around
the Horn, and eight additional ones, most of which had
been completed since the squadron had left the Atlantic
on this voyage sixteen months before. These ships had
steamed 42,000 miles without any hitch or any casualty,
or any untoward circumstance.</p>

<p>When the President first decided that this trip should
be made, all kinds of hostile criticism bristled in the press
of the country. But the President, with his usual alertness,
had several far-sighted purposes in view. He says
in his "Autobiography": "At that time, as I happened
to know neither the English nor the German authorities
believed it possible to take a fleet of great battleships
around the world, I made up my mind that it was time
to have a show-down in the matter; because if it was
really true that our fleet could not get from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, it was much better to know it and be able
to shape our policy in view of the knowledge."</p>

<p>The great show of naval strength on the part of the
United States that this voyage illustrated naturally had
its effect throughout the world. A strength that is not
menacing tends to allay menace. And in this instance
the visit of the fleet to Japan was promptly interpreted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
by the Japanese as one of courtesy and good-will. The
President, again and again in his public utterances, as
well as in his private statements at Cabinet meetings, had
emphasized his view that a strong navy makes for peace.
And toasting the admirals and captains in the cabin of the
Mayflower, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Isn't it magnificent? Nobody after this will forget
that the American coast is on the Pacific as well as on the
Atlantic!"</p>

<p>The home-coming of the fleet was a most imposing
sight. The weather was beautiful, and altogether the
function appeared as calm and peaceful as if it had been
a magnificent pleasure excursion, which indeed it had
proved to be.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On my return to America in the fall of 1913, there were
two notable questions that occupied the attention of
President Wilson and Congress, in which as a private
citizen I had taken some part. I was soon invited by the
National Republican Club to take part in a luncheon
discussion of "Present World Problems," and this enabled
me to discuss a subject that had resulted in a plank
in the National Platform of the Progressive Party, "that
American ships engaged in coastwise trade shall pay no
tolls." As this question did not arise in the New York
State campaign, I had had no occasion to discuss it except
on one occasion when I was asked what my stand was upon
that subject, and I plainly stated that I did not favor the
remission of tolls, as it conflicted with the spirit, if not
with the express wording, of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty,
and that I would only favor it in the event the question
were left to arbitration and decided in our favor. In this
discussion I went somewhat fully into the subject, making
it clear why I was not in favor of free tolls, and why I supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the President in the stand that he had taken for
repeal of the act that freed our coastwise ships from such
tolls.</p>

<p>Others who spoke at this luncheon on various phases
of the general problem were William L. Mackenzie King,
at this writing the Premier of Canada, and Miss Mabel
T. Boardman, representing the American Red Cross.</p>

<p>In April the Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals
held hearings upon an act to amend the Panama Canal
Act repealing the provision providing for freeing coastwise
American ships from tolls. Upon invitation I appeared
before this committee and supported the position
that the President had taken, in opposition to the provisions
of the platform of his party, for the repeal of the
free tolls clause. Upon the urgent request of the President,
the repealing act was passed. Some of our ablest Senators,
regardless of party, took opposing sides upon this question.
Elihu Root, who was then Senator, presented, in my
judgment, the most convincing argument and the ablest
speech of his distinguished career in the Senate, advocating
the repeal of the free tolls clause.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another international subject which I was carefully
studying at this time was our relations with Mexico. I
felt then, as I do now, that our Government has often been
badly served and wrongly advised in regard to affairs in
Mexico. I suggested to the President that he should send
to Mexico a commission of experienced men who could
in a comparatively short time lay before him the true
conditions as a guide for our governmental action. I
pointed out that under circumstances different, but no
less perplexing, this plan had been adopted by Cleveland
during the Venezuela trouble, and that the appointment
of that commission, of which Justice Brewer of the Supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Court was chairman, had hastened the solution.
When the idea of the United States sending a commission
such as I recommended became publicly known, it
was favorably received by General Huerta, the then President
of Mexico, as well as by Carranza. The appointment
of such a commission would have had the additional
effect of offsetting the pressure in Congress for intervention,
and several of the leading Senators expressed
themselves as favoring it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When storm clouds are rushing across the sky, it is very
difficult to foretell where the lightning will strike. It is
needless here to discuss the professed but spurious reasons
why Italy declared war upon Turkey in 1911. It was
evident that no <i>casus belli</i> existed in any international
sense. The naked fact was that Italy determined to have
a slice of northern Africa, and was favored in that craving
by several of the Great Powers, chiefly to prevent
Germany from getting a foothold on the Mediterranean.
I knew from my observations in Turkey that this aggressive
action on the part of Italy would far transcend the
interest of either Italy or Turkey, and would inevitably
arouse the restless Balkan Powers to action.</p>

<p>In a communication that I sent to Secretary of State
Knox on September 29, 1911, attention was directed to
what would probably be the outcome of this action on the
part of Italy; also that the Hague Treaty not only sanctioned,
but made it morally incumbent upon Powers that
were strangers to the dispute, to tender their good offices
for the purpose of a peaceful adjustment. Just because
the United States could not be accused of having any
direct interest, such an offer could have been made with
best grace by our country. If ever there had been a war
of conquest, that was one. One of the London papers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
frankly criticized Italy's precipitous act as that of "pirate,
brigand, and buccaneer."</p>

<p>In an article written for "The Outlook" following a
number of public addresses upon the same subject, I
pointed out that Turkey, both immediately before and
since hostilities began, had appealed to the Christian
nations of the world, who were co-signatories with her of
the Hague Treaty, to use their good offices for peace, but
the Christian nations had declined to act. In this article
I stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>So far as it opens an era possibly of the gravest menace to
Europe, it is primarily of European concern; but in so far as
the provisions of the Peace Treaty are disregarded by neutral
Powers, this is a grave moral loss no less for us than for all
nations, the magnitude of which is not lessened, but increased
by the fact that Christian Italy is making an unprovoked war
upon a Mohammedan Power. The efforts to bring about a
peaceful adjustment under the circumstances is not only a
moral right, but a right under the Convention in which Turkey,
Italy, and the United States are equally signatories with the
other forty-one nations.</p>

<p>The international moral damage this war entails is the concern
of all nations. The manner in which it was precipitated
without first having recourse to the enlightened methods of
peaceful adjustment, combined with the concerted refusal of
European Powers to attempt mediation, will make peace
treaties waste paper, and peace professions of civilized nations
sham and hypocrisy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In quick succession this war was followed in 1912 by
the first Balkan war against Turkey, and then in 1913
by the second Balkan war, between the Balkan nations
themselves to divide the spoils. For thirty years the
Treaty of Berlin (1878) had served to maintain European
peace. The first breach was the annexation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina by Austria. The second was the Italian-Turkish
war, followed by the Balkan wars. The toll of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
these latter wars entailed a sacrifice of 300,000 dead or
permanently disabled on the field of battle; and the immediate
consequence was to upset "the balance of power"
so that the Great Powers at once heavily extended their
armies and navies, and their budgets ran wild.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Probably the most illuminating document concerning
the conditions that led up to the World War is the Lichnowsky
Memorandum which is entitled: "My London
Mission, 1912-1914." I had known Prince Lichnowsky
when he was one of the secretaries of the German Embassy
during my first mission to Turkey. He was appointed
ambassador to England after the death of Baron
Marschall in September, 1912. This memorandum was
prepared as a personal record during the second year of
the war, and, after being privately circulated, was, by
design or otherwise, published. It is the most convincing
indictment of Germany's ruthless aggressive policy, and
it naturally brought down upon its author the severest
condemnation of the Emperor and the militarists. Germany's
reiterated claim that Great Britain, having
designed Germany's destruction, sought to justify the
large increase of her navy, was disproved by her own
ambassador.</p>

<p>The events that resolved themselves into the World
War, as well as the World War itself, are most convincing
proofs that the preservation of peace is a matter of common
interest to the entire family of nations, and that it
must not be left to a single member of this group to
disturb the world's peace at will.</p>

<p>Motoring leisurely through Algiers and Tunis with Mrs.
Straus, I was now enjoying a delightful holiday, free from
cares and responsibility. The drowsy tropical air invited
complete relaxation, and the lazy African days ushered
us into a world unbelievably remote from that of American
politics. Graceful, luminous Algiers, with its brilliant
European hotels, charming cafés, veiled women, and
swarthy men, etched lasting impressions upon our minds.
My defeat in the tense Progressive contest for the governorship
of New York had afforded me this opportunity
for another taste of freedom. It was in the spring of the
year 1913, and the mountains through which we toured
were full of unexpected and beguiling scenes. This region
is not only rich in historic associations, but the engineering
skill of the French has in turn modernized it with
excellent motor roads. From Tunis we crossed to Sicily,
where we visited the Carthaginian, Greek, and Roman
remains of columns and temples that still bear tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
witness to the conflict between the armies of Hannibal
and Scipio, and between the transplanted Asiatic and
European civilizations.</p>

<p>We made our way to Rome, where Ambassador
Thomas J. O'Brien showed us many attentions, and
arranged for an audience on April 28th with Victor
Emmanuel III. The King was most affable and agreeable,
and spoke perfect English. He referred to my several
missions to Turkey, and said he, too, was there frequently
when he was in the navy. He spoke with an
intimate knowledge of the men and affairs in the Near
East that surprised me. We discussed Arabia and the
unrest there due to the incompetency of the Sultan's
Government, and soon the conversation turned to the
Balkan situation. I said I feared that as soon as the
treaty then being negotiated, which was to end the first
Balkan War against Turkey, was signed, a fresh war
would break out among the five Balkan Powers. That
would not surprise him, he said, but considered that it
might be best to let them fight it out. I answered that
the trouble with that course was that the fight would
involve the Great Powers, as the several Balkan States
were attached to strings that led directly into the chancelleries
of the Great Powers&mdash;with which the King did
not disagree.</p>

<p>We talked of the Jews, and he said in Italy they were
not made a separate element in the population. "We
neither know nor care whether a man is a Jew or not," he
remarked, adding that the only persons who took special
notice of the subject at all were occasional clericals. Personally
he was very fond of the Jews; nearly every ministry
had contained one or more; and General Ottolenghi,
a Jew who had been Minister of War a few years before,
had been one of his most favored instructors. Altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
we had a fine talk of over an hour. The King's quick and
vigorous mind, his clearness of vision and breadth of
intellectual grasp I found very refreshing. Unlike some
of the monarchs, he did not seem detached and weighted
down by a sense of his own importance.</p>

<p>From my friend Isaac N. Seligman, since deceased, of
New York, I had received a letter of introduction to
Ernesto Nathan, Mayor of Rome, of whom I had heard
much and whom I was therefore anxious to meet. I sent
Mr. Seligman's letter, together with my card, to the
Mayor. The next morning, when Mrs. Straus and I were
leaving our hotel for a motor ride, a tall, prepossessing
gentleman, who impressed me somewhat as a typical
Englishman, came toward me with a look of recognition
which I instinctively answered.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Straus? I am Mr. Nathan," he said, in
perfect English.</p>

<p>His brother was with him, and we were glad to return
to the hotel with them for a chat. We arranged for a little
excursion the next day to the ancient Roman commercial
city of Ostia, whose ruins were being excavated. In the
midst of these plans the Mayor remarked that a friend of
his, Georg Brandes, the Danish savant and critic, was in
Rome, and if agreeable to us he would like to have him
join us. Of course it was agreeable, and in our little party
next day were Mayor Nathan, his brother, his daughter,
Georg Brandes, a Signor Cena, editor of a leading Italian
review, and ourselves. The Mayor acted as guide and
showed an astonishing familiarity with things archæological
in a most delightful way; even the occasional spells
of rain in no way dampened our enjoyment of the trip.
Upon our return, the Mayor took us to lunch in a typical
Italian restaurant, where we spent two hours at a sociable
repast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>My introduction to Mayor Ernesto Nathan led to a
friendship which I prized highly and enjoyed until his
death in April, 1921. He was born in England of Jewish
parents. His father was a banker and a descendant of the
Frankfort family of Nathans, a collateral branch of the
Mayer family from whom is descended the great banking
family of Rothschild. After his father died, his mother
took the family to Pisa to live. Here their home became
a refuge for Italian patriots, as it had been in London.
At twenty-five Signor Nathan became business manager
of "La Roma del Popolo," a paper started by Giuseppe
Mazzini, a friend of the family, whose works he later
edited. Nathan remained an editor and publisher until
he entered politics. He became Mayor of Rome in 1907,
elected by the anti-clerical party, and during the six
years he remained Mayor he did much to modernize
Rome, especially in the improvement of its street-car
service and its sanitation, so that the city's death-rate
became one of the lowest in Europe. He was highly esteemed,
and even the clericals respected his uprightness
and efficiency.</p>

<p>Brandes, when I met him, was nearly seventy years
old, but intellectually vigorous and brilliant, although
cynical, even if at times humorously and delightfully
so.</p>

<p>Through David Lubin, American delegate to the International
Institute of Agriculture, whom I had known
for many years, we met Professor Luigi Luzzatti, Professor
of International Law at the University of Rome, a
leading member of the Italian Chamber, and a convincing
orator and publicist. He was then in his seventies, a
large, statesmanlike figure of distinguished appearance.
We spent a pleasant hour in his apartment on the Via
Veneto opposite our hotel. He said he was gratified to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
find my views, as expressed in my "Roger Williams" and
in my chapter on the development of religious liberty in
my "American Spirit," so much in accord with his own.
He told me about his brochure, "Liberta di Consciensa
e di Sciensa," which had been translated into German
under the title "Freiheit des Gewissens und Wissens."
In it he makes considerable reference to Roger Williams,
and pays me the compliment of saying that he derived
the inspiration for his book from mine. He also quotes
extensively from Roosevelt's letter on religious liberty,
which I have embodied in Chapter X of this volume.</p>

<p>I called on Professor Luzzatti a number of times thereafter,
which in his charming way he had begged me to do
because he was confined to the house with a cold and
therefore could not call on me. In one of his notes he
wrote that we were friends because our ideas and ideals
were the same, and he wanted to be sure to see me again
before I left Rome. He confirmed what the King had
told me, that there was no anti-Semitic spirit in Italy.
He said he was a Jew, but was not brought up religiously
as such, although he was known to be ready on all necessary
occasions to stand up for his people.</p>

<p>Professor Luzzatti was largely responsible for improving
Italy's financial system, and in the establishment of
the Banca Popolari, or People's Banks. He was also
influential in the negotiation of Italy's commercial
treaties.</p>

<p>Through the offices of P. R. Mackenzie, who for a
number of years had been Rome correspondent of the
"New York Sun," I met Cardinals Rampolla and Falconio.
We called first on the latter, who knew our country
well. For nine years he had been papal legate at Washington,
during which time he became a naturalized citizen.
As we entered his reception room, I observed two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
little American flags attached to an ornament on the
center table. He informed, me as he greeted me that His
Holiness was quite ill, otherwise he would have advised
me to allow Cardinal Rampolla and himself to arrange
for an audience.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie informed the Cardinal that I had been
a member of the Roosevelt Cabinet, which recalled
Roosevelt's visit to Rome in 1910. Of course, I was
anxious to learn how both these prelates regarded that
incident. Cardinal Falconio said that the Holy Father
had made no conditions as to the visit, but had merely
expressed the hope that there might be no repetition of
the Fairbanks incident; the Holy Father knew how
broad-minded and well-disposed Roosevelt was toward
all creeds and had really wanted very much to meet him.
The Cardinal said that of course Roosevelt could not
be blamed; the matter should not have been handled
through the embassy. His remarks implied that the mismanagement
had been there.</p>

<p>We now went within the Vatican district, under the
arch on the side, to the palatial residence of Cardinal
Rampolla. On entering, we were led to the Cardinal's
private room next to the formal reception chamber,
where the Cardinal greeted us warmly. He has great
charm of manner and is most gracious; withal he impressed
one as a keen, learned, and shrewd prelate. He
was regarded as the ablest and most distinguished of the
cardinals eligible to the Holy See, and it may be remembered
that he was considered the logical successor of
Leo XIII, and it was said he would probably have been
elected Pope but for the opposition of the Emperor of
Austria.</p>

<p>In referring to the Roosevelt incident, he too held
Roosevelt entirely blameless, and added that both he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Brother Falconio knew how kindly Roosevelt felt toward
Catholics and the Holy See, and that there should have
been nothing official about that message; if he had been
in Merry Del Val's place, the regrettable misunderstanding
would not have happened. Evidently he blamed the
papal secretary.</p>

<p>David Lubin gave a dinner at the Hôtel de Russie to
Mrs. Straus and me on May 1st. Among the guests were
Mayor Nathan and Marquis Sapelli, president of the
International Institute of Agriculture, and the Marchioness.
Professor Luzzatti had accepted, but his cold
still prevented his going out. Lubin was a rough diamond,
so to speak: a man of vision, unlimited energy and
enthusiasm. It was he who induced the Italian Government
to recognize the International Institute of Agriculture,
and he was regarded by that Government as its
founder. Indeed, he was better understood in Rome than
in Washington. He knew nothing and cared less about
diplomatic amenities. When I was in the Cabinet our
ambassador at Rome had made an unfavorable report
about him because of some supposed tactless move which
was objected to by our ambassador. This report displeased
Secretary Root, and the result would have been
Lubin's recall as our delegate to the Institute, had I not
interceded for him with the President, explaining what
manner of man Lubin was, that he had no manners but
genius, and that I felt sure the King of Italy himself
would intercede for him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact about a year after that there was
some question of appointing another person as American
delegate, and the King did intercede for Lubin. For the
help and encouragement that I gave this worthy man he
was always thereafter most grateful to me. It was David
Lubin, too, who first aroused interest in America in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
establishment of an agricultural credit system, as well as
in the coöperative banks.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From Rome we went direct to London, where I shortly
got in touch with William Watson, the poet. I had met
him the year before in the United States. I was chairman
of the executive committee of the Authors' Club at the
time, and as such its president; the Club gave him a
reception; also he was at my house several times. It was
said of him that he was better known than Robert Bridges
and would have been selected as poet laureate in preference
to Bridges had he not written a poem called "The
Woman with the Serpent's Tongue," referring to Margot
Asquith, wife of the Premier, which spoiled his chances
for official recognition. He appeared somewhat disappointed
and to be considering permanent residence in
America. He asked me about the cost of living in cities
other than New York, which he considered too extravagant.</p>

<p>Watson gave me a luncheon at the British Empire Club,
where I met a number of his friends&mdash;Sir Sidney Lee,
editor of the "Dictionary of National Biography";
Sir William Robertson Nicoll, editor of the "Bookman"
and of the "British Weekly"; H. W. Massingham,
editor of the "Nation"; and a few others. Watson
told me that Sir Sidney Lee's biography of Shakespeare
was considered the best extant from an historical and
critical point of view, and that his biography of King
Edward had created a sensation in England, but that its
aim was to portray the human side of King Edward. He
told me also that Sir Sidney was an Israelite. My own
conversation with Sir Sidney was very general. He is a
mild man with a reserved manner.</p>

<p>Sir Charles and Lady Henry invited us to luncheon at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
their beautiful town house in Carlton Gardens, to meet
Lloyd George, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The other guests were: Sir Alexander Ure, solicitor-general
for Scotland; Dr. Thomas J. MacNamara, parliamentary
secretary to the Admiralty; Robert Donald,
editor of the "Daily Chronicle," a leading labor daily.</p>

<p>Lloyd George explained the important Liberal measures
to me, particularly the National Insurance Act of
1911, amendments to which were then being considered
in the House. He declared that it was necessary to curb
or reform the House of Lords before social justice measures,
such as this insurance act, legislation for old age
pensions, etc., could be put through. He asked about
Roosevelt and the status of the Progressive Party, and
whether the newspapers were favorable to the cause; it
seems that the newspapers did not give him adequate
information regarding the Progressives. I had to tell him
that many of our leading dailies were not with us. I
explained to him that I thought the Progressive movement
could hardly be regarded as a party, but that I
believed its influence in liberalizing both of the old parties
would be considerable.</p>

<p>When I was in London shortly after the outbreak of
the World War, I remember a humorous incident at
another meeting with Lloyd George, at a small dinner.
For emergency use there had been issued one-pound
treasury notes that looked more like a "shinplaster" of
our Civil War days than like a dignified British pound.
One of the guests brought in a number of these, for which
some of us exchanged gold. As I took one up I remarked
about the appearance of it and added that before I accepted
it I would require the endorsement of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Lloyd George quickly answered,
"That can be done," and promptly took the note and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
wrote his name on the back of it. It remains in my possession
as a souvenir.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, Sir Charles and Lady Henry
again invited us to luncheon, this time to their country
home near Maidenhead, to meet Sir Rufus and Lady
Isaacs. Sir Rufus is now Lord Reading, and it was then
quite well understood that he would be appointed Lord
Chief Justice. He expressed great interest in our parliamentary
system as compared with that of Great Britain,
but thought the British method had an advantage over
ours in that members of the Cabinet were at the same
time members of Parliament and could advocate their
own measures, and that in England a Cabinet member
must be not only an administrator, but a parliamentarian
as well. He was very anxious to know how administrative
measures in our country are brought forward and enacted
into laws. I explained our system to him and told him I
thought the system of questioning in Parliament members
of the Cabinet left very little opportunity for the
Cabinet members to devote themselves to the administrative
work of their departments.</p>

<p>During this stay in London, I again had several pleasant
meetings with Postmaster-General Herbert Samuel,
whom I had visited when I passed through London on
my return from Constantinople in 1910. He informed me
that within a month he intended visiting Canada and
then the United States. Later in the year I met him in
my own country, where he delivered several public addresses
and made a fine impression.</p>

<p>While we were at tea one afternoon on the terrace of
the House of Commons with Mr. and Mrs. Samuel, the
Right Honorable John Burns, president of the Local
Government Board, joined us. He knew both my brothers
and was pleased to meet me. He asked me to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
him to his department, which is only a short
distance from Westminster Hall. As we passed the entrance
to Westminster, he said to me:</p>

<p>"Let us stop here and let me give you a graphic page
of British history."</p>

<p>So we halted for about ten minutes under the scaffolding
of the men who were doing some repair work on the
edifice, while Burns discoursed eloquently on the well-known
facts of British history. I was as much interested
in the man as in the great Gothic structure, and my mind
went on to review the march of democracy from the
booted and spurred Cromwell to the radical labor leader
John Burns. The radicalism of Burns was at one time
considered dangerous, but on entering the Cabinet he
became conservative and reliable, proving the effect of
responsibility upon even the more radical minds when in
office.</p>

<p>Across the Thames Burns pointed to some factories,
saying: "There is where my father worked as a day
laborer, and where I worked." And I was indeed impressed
with the democracy of Great Britain in our day.</p>

<p>We spent a charming evening with Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Brittain, now Sir Harry and Lady Brittain, in
their cozy home on Cowley Street. The only other guest
was Earl Grey, former Governor-General of Canada.
Earlier in the year I had met both Sir Harry Brittain and
Earl Grey in New York, when they came over respectively
as chairman and secretary of the British committee for
the Celebration of One Hundred Years of Peace.</p>

<p>A few days thereafter Earl Grey invited Mrs. Brittain,
Mrs. Straus, and me to breakfast with him and then to
accompany him to the now famous Hampstead Garden
Suburb. I was glad of this opportunity to see that experiment,
because the subject of housing workers in wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
homes and surroundings at a moderate cost was one
that interested me very much.</p>

<p>Hampstead is only about five or six miles from the
heart of London. In this beautiful suburb, every house
has a garden, and the architecture of the houses is varied
and attractive. Earl Grey knew several of the tenants,
and took us into a number of the houses. At that time
the rental of an entire house per week was six and a half
shillings and upward; and there were large single rooms
with cooking facilities for three and a half shillings a
week. The population was almost seven thousand, and
the suburb was being extended. There was an air of contentment
about the place, and the children looked robust
and happy. The wonder of it all was that the plan was
on an economically sound basis and was paying four and
a half per cent annually on the capital invested. The Earl
had much to do with the development of this suburb and,
if I mistake not, was chairman of the board at the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Straus and I were also invited to spend a week-end
with Earl and Lady Grey at Howick, their Northumberland
estate. Mrs. Straus, however, had planned to
take a cure at a German health resort, so my son Roger
was invited in her stead. The only other visitor was
Henry Vivian, M.P., who was associated with Earl Grey
in both the Hampstead Garden Suburb and the organization
of the coöperative societies, of which latter Earl
Grey was chairman. I participated in a meeting of the
Coöperative Society of Northern England and saw how
practical and inexpensively conducted they were, cheapening
merchandise of all kinds by eliminating the profits
of middlemen and the cost of distribution, and to that
extent lowering the cost of living. Along these lines we
have much to learn in our own country.</p>

<p>Roger and I spent a delightful few days with Earl and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Lady Grey. The Earl represented the finest type of English
nobleman. He was a man of the highest ideals, even
regarded by some as rather visionary in his various plans
for the betterment of economic conditions; a man who
recognized, as do so many of the British titled people, the
patriotic responsibilities attached to their position.</p>

<p>I now proceeded to the northern part of Scotland to
spend a few days with Andrew Carnegie at Skibo Castle
in Sutherland. It was what Andrew Carnegie called
"university week" at Skibo, for in accordance with an
annual custom he had as his guests the provosts of the
several Scotch universities.</p>

<p>Every morning we were awakened by the music of
several Scotch highlanders dressed in their kilts and playing
old native tunes on their bagpipes. Those were unique
and memorable awakenings in the steel-master's castle;
the bagpipes attuned the mind instantly to the Scotch
atmosphere and Scotch tradition. We started our day
invariably with a game of golf, at which we helped each
other out as caddies, for all of us, Mr. Carnegie included,
were indifferent players (beyond which stage I have not
even since progressed), so that we all felt quite at home
with one another on the links.</p>

<p>We had hoped to test Carnegie's much-lauded and
far-famed salmon pond, but that season the fish were late
in coming up the run, so we were deprived of that pleasure
and had to console ourselves with a little trout fishing.
Two or three were put into each of our baskets for
breakfast, and the remainder were religiously restored
to the pond.</p>

<p>At that time Skibo Castle had but recently been built,
but already it was noted for its generous hospitality,
which both the British and American friends of Mr.
Carnegie so much enjoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>I had promised Mr. Carnegie that I would attend the
ceremonies opening the Peace Palace at The Hague, to
which all the members of the Hague Tribunal had been
specially invited. From Skibo, therefore, I returned to
London, to meet my old friend Hakki Pasha, who was
one of the Turkish members of the Tribunal, and together
we went on to The Hague.</p>

<p>A word about the origin of the Peace Palace may not
prove tedious. Shortly after the close of the first Hague
Conference in 1899 the late Professor Martens, distinguished
Russian international jurist, had a talk with our
ambassador at Berlin, Andrew D. White, who had been
chairman of the American delegation at that conference.
Together they discussed the desirability of a building at
The Hague which should serve as a "palace of justice"
for the Permanent Court and as a place of meetings for
international conferences. Subsequently Ambassador
White presented the idea to Andrew Carnegie, and Carnegie
invited him to come to Skibo to discuss it. Ambassador
White records in his "Autobiography":</p>

<blockquote><p>The original idea had developed into something far greater.
The Peace Palace at The Hague began to reappear in a new
glory&mdash;as a pledge and sign of a better future for the world.
Then there came from Carnegie the words which assured his
great gift to the nations&mdash;the creation of a center as a symbol
of a world's desire for peace and of good will to man.</p></blockquote>

<p>The programme for the dedication was in keeping with
the occasion. The city itself was decorated with festive
drapery and floral arches. It was a beautiful day and
great crowds of people had gathered. The great conference
hall and the galleries of the Palace were filled with
representatives of the nations: the diplomatic corps;
about forty members of the Permanent Court; members
of the States General of Holland; the Queen; Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Henry; the Queen Mother, and many ladies; altogether
an imposing assembly.</p>

<p>The ceremony opened with the singing of anthems by
the choir from Amsterdam. An historical address was
made by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jonkheer
van Karnebeek, president of the Carnegie Building
Foundation. His son, by the way, is Minister of Foreign
Affairs at this writing and was Holland's chief representative
at the Washington Conference of 1921. Mr.
Van Swinderen, the retiring Minister of Foreign Affairs,
made the address accepting the custody of the building.</p>

<p>In the evening a banquet to Mr. Carnegie was given in
the Hall of Knights at Binnenhof by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs in the name of the Government, to which
were invited the nobility and all the high officials who had
attended the ceremony, and who thereafter were received
in audience by the Queen at the Royal Palace.</p>

<p>The greatest possible distinction was shown to both
Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie, who were brimming over with
gratification. Well known as Carnegie was as one of the
greatest captains of industry, he is even better known,
and will be longer remembered throughout the world,
by the extent of his benefactions, in the distribution of
which he found his supreme happiness in the last two
decades of his life.</p>

<p>When the World War began, the cartoonists made
much sport of the Peace Palace as the outstanding embodiment
of the irony of fate, and with the peace advocates
for the failure of their vision. But evidence is not
entirely lacking that the peace advocates may yet be able
to turn the laugh on the cartoonists. Some of the most
constructive features of the League of Nations were
formulated by commissions working under the roof of the
Peace Palace. The International Court of Justice, organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
under the provisions of the covenant of the League of
Nations, has its seat within the Palace and will soon be
ready to commence its constructive work. The Palace is
a contribution whose worth to civilization can hardly be
measured in a single generation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the fall of that year we returned to New York, but
only for a few months. When Kermit Roosevelt became
engaged to Miss Willard, charming daughter of our ambassador
to Spain, my wife promised him that unless
we were unavoidably prevented, we should be present at
his marriage in Madrid early in the following June. We
had become very much attached to our young friend,
whom we got to know so well during his stay with us at
Constantinople.</p>

<p>On May 19, 1914, we returned to Europe on the S.S.
Lusitania. On board we were agreeably surprised to find
our long-time friend, Mrs. T. J. Preston, Jr., formerly
Mrs. Grover Cleveland, seated at our table in the dining-saloon.
She was traveling alone and was to meet her
husband and daughter in London. Naturally we spoke of
Cleveland and of his qualities as they had revealed themselves
to her and to his more intimate friends. When a
man is President and always in the limelight, people get
a perverted impression of him, a fact true more or less
since Washington's day, but perhaps to a greater degree
in the case of Cleveland. Mrs. Preston referred to many
incidents that illustrated his gentleness and consideration,
and she gave credit to his advice and guidance for
much of the tact she displayed as mistress of the White
House, for she was scarcely out of her teens when she
occupied that important post.</p>

<p>In London I received a letter from Roosevelt saying he
would meet us in Paris on June 7th, and suggesting that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
I keep in touch with our embassy there. Miss Catherine
Page also was going to the wedding to be one of the
bridesmaids, and Ambassador Page asked us to take her
with us, which of course we were glad to do.</p>

<p>We stayed in London for several days, and soon after
our arrival, there was a young people's dance at the embassy
to which the ambassador asked us to come if only
for a short stay. There we met Mr. and Mrs. Rudyard
Kipling. In the course of a pleasant chat, I asked Kipling
in what work he was then engaged.</p>

<p>Kipling pointed to the next room at the dancing, and
said: "Sitting up late nights as I have a daughter in
society, which is my principal occupation at present."</p>

<p>I spent an evening with Israel Zangwill, during which
he unfolded to me a plan he was formulating to call a
conference of representative Jews from various countries
to form a central committee which was to be more internationally
representative than the Alliance Israélite of
Paris, which is in reality dominantly French and therefore
does not represent the world of Israel in an international
sense. Such a body was to protect, defend, and
plead for the cause of the Jews wherever necessary and to
speak in behalf of the Jewry of the world. He said he
had talked it over with his colleagues and they wanted
me to take the presidency of such a body because of my
experience in statesmanship and world diplomacy. I
took care not to discourage him, but told him I should
have to consider the matter, because with me personality
sank out of sight when an important cause was to be
carried forward.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Paris, a note awaited us from
Ambassador Herrick asking us to come to the embassy,
and informing us that Roosevelt was there. When I
arrived I found Roosevelt in the smoking-room engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
in an animated conversation with ex-Premier Hanotaux
regarding the physical characteristics of the races of
Europe, in which Henri Bergson also participated, and to
which the sculptor Rodin appeared to be a bored listener.
Roosevelt was talking French, and when he could not
find the word he wanted, he used an English term for
which Bergson would then give him the French equivalent.</p>

<p>The next day our party left for Madrid&mdash;Roosevelt,
his daughter Alice, their cousin Philip, son of William
Emlen Roosevelt, Miss Page, Mrs. Straus, and myself.
We were a jolly party.</p>

<p>Roosevelt and I, of course, talked politics, especially
the future of the Progressive Party. The State campaign
for Governor and United States Senator was being discussed
when Roosevelt left home, and he had given
out an interview before sailing regarding the sort of men
that should be chosen, in which he had kindly referred to
me as the standard of nominee for Senator. The press
had commented extensively and favorably upon such a
choice and there had appeared many articles and editorials
giving consideration to my name. Roosevelt had, of
course, referred to me only as the type of man to be
chosen, and believed that if the nominee for Governor
were chosen from New York City, it might be well to
choose the candidate for Senator from up-State. I told
him I had no personal vanity in the matter, that what
we wanted was the candidates that would best embody
the cause. He answered that he knew me well enough for
that, but that every one agreed that next to him I was
the most prominent Progressive, and in New York State
even stronger than he, as shown by the election of 1912.
Of course I did not agree with this generous statement,
which was another proof that figures do sometimes lie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>He expressed the hope that the Progressives and the
liberal wing of the Republicans might unite. He lamented
the difficulties for the party in the coming election,
and said he was reluctant to enter the campaign,
but, he added: "I must stand by the men who stood by
me." If Johnson was again to be the candidate of the
party for Governor of California and needed his help, he
would have to go there, though he could not overtax his
throat, which had been weakened by his fever in the
jungles of Brazil. He said if that fever had overtaken
him two weeks earlier, he would not have pulled through;
as it was, he had had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>At Irun, the Spanish border, King Alphonso's private
car was hitched on to our train. From there on to the
King's summer palace, where he left the train, a small
guard of honor was drawn up at every stopping-place and
the chief officials of the district came to pay their respects
to their sovereign. The King was only twenty-eight
years old, but was generally conceded to be a man of
ability, with enlightened views, and highly regarded by
his subjects. However, among the random notes that I
made at the end of this visit to Spain, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I very much doubt if monarchy will last another score of
years in Spain unless the King takes a lesson from Great
Britain and is content to have Parliament govern the country.
The democratic spirit is rapidly growing, but I very
much doubt if the people with their long traditions of monarchical
government, will be prepared for many years for a
democratic form of government.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most powerful man in Parliament, though out of
the Ministry at the time, was the late Premier Maurer.
The Conservatives were in power, but their tenure was
precarious. It was said that Maurer's ancestors several
generations ago were Jews, which is also true of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
members of the nobility, whose ancestors were converted
during the period of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Our ambassador and his staff of secretaries were at the
station in Madrid to meet us. The Roosevelts went to
the embassy and we went to the Ritz Hotel. At eleven
o'clock on the morning of June 10th, the civil marriage
took place in the Prefecture of Police before a district
judge. It was a simple proceeding, attended only by the
immediate family and a few intimate friends, perhaps a
dozen in all. The ceremony was read from a book in
which was included the marriage contract. The bride
and groom and four witnesses then signed the contract,
the witnesses on this occasion being the father of the
bride, the father of the groom, and two Spanish noblemen.</p>

<p>The following day at high noon the religious ceremony
was performed in the chapel of the British embassy.
There were about seventy-five persons present: the diplomatic
corps, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and several
other Spanish officials, and some friends. After the ceremony,
there was a wedding breakfast at the embassy.
The Roosevelts left that same evening for Paris, and I
did not see them again in Europe.</p>

<p>This was our second visit to Spain. In 1897 my wife
and I had been there for about a week, and many of the
men with whom we had spent pleasant hours at that
time were now no longer living. Chief among these were
Sir Henry Drummond Wolff and Signor Castelar. Sir
Henry, who was British ambassador to Spain at the time,
I had not seen since he was special envoy to Turkey in
1888, and I remember how delighted he was to see us
again and how very much at home he made us feel. We
also met Lady Wolff then, who, however, was not well.
She told us of some of her experiences in Persia; also that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Sir Henry was very ill there, having been poisoned at a
dinner given by the Shah.</p>

<p>Another colleague of my first Turkish mission whom
I had found at Madrid in 1897 was Herr von Radowitz,
German ambassador. He invited us to dine one evening
at the embassy, and after dinner showed us the throne
room in which hung a picture of the Kaiser. Radowitz
explained that it was painted by a friend of the Emperor,
"somewhat theatrical, you see, but he is fond of appearing
grandiose." He started to tell me how he came into
possession of the painting, that he had told the Emperor
that the embassy had no likeness of him, but he corrected
himself by saying: "No, I did not ask for the picture, my
wife did." He displayed rather a slighting estimate of his
sovereign. The fact was that he was a protégé of Bismarck,
and after the latter's retirement Radowitz was
transferred from Constantinople to Madrid, which was
regarded in the nature of a demotion, and that perhaps
largely accounted for his attitude.</p>

<p>As we conversed after dinner, Radowitz made the
remark that in 1878 he was one of the secretaries to the
Berlin Congress and that there he met Disraeli. Disraeli
always made specially prepared speeches in English,
which Radowitz took down in French. Then Disraeli
would compliment him and say, "Did I really speak in
this nice way or did you only write me down so elegantly?"
When Radowitz replied, "Yes, this is what
you said," Disraeli would say, "So let it stand."</p>

<p>This led me to draw out Sir Henry, who was also present,
regarding Disraeli. He had known Disraeli very well.
He told me that at the age of twelve he had met Disraeli
and had always had access to him. I asked Sir Henry
whether he had not kept a diary. He said he had not,
but wished that he had. "Dizzy," he said, was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
compromiser; if he had opponents, he recognized them as
such and never sought to placate them. When he first
entered Parliament he was a brilliant, flowery speaker, so
much so that his party, the Conservative, was afraid of
him. Afterward, when he became a member of the Ministry,
he had trained himself down to a rather prosy level,
yet now and again his speech would glow with brilliant
passages excoriating his opponent. He was quick at
repartee and often held up the other side to ridicule in
telling metaphor.</p>

<p>I asked Sir Henry about Dizzy's loyalty to Judaism.
He said Dizzy never denied it, holding up especially
the race idea. I remarked that in reading such of Disraeli's
novels as "Coningsby" and "Tancred," and in
the Proceedings of the Berlin Congress, I was impressed
with his race loyalty and his purpose to secure equal
political rights for the oppressed members of his race in
the newly constituted Balkan States.</p>

<p>Sir Henry answered me: "I don't recall the novels, but
what you say was true, although of course his loyalty
was to England first. Dizzy's idea was that the race
should amalgamate."</p>

<p>I wanted to know whether he recollected when Disraeli's
novels first came out. He said he remembered all
but "Vivian Grey," which Dizzy wrote when he was
quite young. He added that Disraeli's writings made him
quite a lion among the literary set, but did not help him
politically. He wanted to count among the best socially,
and ever pointed his political guns toward that target.</p>

<p>When I asked Sir Henry about Disraeli's personal
appearance, he said: "Lord Dufferin (Frederic Blackwood)
looked very much like him; so much so that he
might have been taken for Disraeli's son. Dizzy and Mrs.
Blackwood were said to be very good friends. He met her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
on many of his frequent visits to the home of Lady Blessington,
during the period when he was beginning to gain
popularity."</p>

<p>Sir Henry had been rather critical of Disraeli, but he
ended by saying: "Taking Dizzy all in all, he was the
greatest English statesman I have ever known." And to
me Disraeli had always been a fascinating subject, so
much so, indeed, that at one time I had the intention
to write a biography of him.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>With Emilio Castelar I had come into correspondence
following the publication of the French edition of my
"Origin of the Republican Form of Government in the
United States," in which he was much interested. He
expressed the hope that the next time I came to Europe
we might meet, and when I came to Madrid, Mr. Reed,
for many years secretary of our legation there, made an
appointment for me, and accompanied Mrs. Straus and
me to his home.</p>

<p>He was a short, rather stout man of sixty-five, bald,
with dark skin and sparkling brown eyes, and a gray
moustache. He was a bachelor. We spoke French, and
though it was an ordinary conversation he was quite
oratorical. He said he was a republican and believed
thoroughly in conservative republicanism such as we had
in the United States, but that Spain was not ripe for
republicanism, and that he had parted company with the
Spanish republicans because he could not endure their
principles; they were ready to pull down, but not to build
up; they were anarchists, and not republicans.</p>

<p>He presented Mrs. Straus with his photograph, and
when she asked him to autograph it, he returned to his
study and wrote in Spanish on the back of it a charming
sentiment regarding us and our country. He was anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
to have us come and take Spanish dinner with him,
but unfortunately we were leaving that evening for
Seville.</p>

<p>I was interested in some articles Castelar had written
for the "Century Magazine" in 1892-93 regarding Columbus,
and especially in those of the articles in which he
referred to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. I asked
him whether he had finished the work, and he told me he
had brought it out complete in book form in Spanish, in
which he had dwelt more fully on the Jewish expulsion
and had published a number of facts from original research
made for the work, though not by himself. He
went to his study to give me a copy of the book, but
found that he had none on hand. He promised to send
me one in a few days through Mr. Reed, which he did.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the Spanish Jews was of great interest
to me, and on this second visit to Madrid I took advantage
of the opportunity to see some of the historical relics
from that period. I got in touch with Dr. Angel Pulido,
life senator of Spain, and together with Professor A. S.
Yahuda, we visited the historic city of Toledo, about
two and a half hours by rail out of Madrid. Dr. Pulido
had for years advocated measures to induce Jews to
return to Spain, especially those who still retained the
Spanish language, as do many in Turkey and nearly all
those in Morocco who are the descendants of those driven
out of Spain.</p>

<p>Toledo is one of the most ancient cities of Spain. It
was once the residence of the kings of Castile, and under
the Moors had a population of some two hundred thousand,
of whom seventy-five thousand were estimated to
have been Jews. The population now is about twenty
thousand, and the city is but the bedraggled remains of
its former grandeur. In its ancient glory it was noted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
its silk and woolen industries and for the manufacture of
the famous Toledo steel from which were made swords
and other weapons that rivaled those of Damascus; and
it was the home of a number of Jewish scholars and noted
men, Eben Ezra (1119-74), for instance.</p>

<p>There are two old synagogues in the city which I was
anxious to see. One was erected at the end of the twelfth
or beginning of the thirteenth century, and was converted
into a church in 1405. It is called Santa Maria la Blanca.
Its architecture is of the best Moorish style; the interior
has twenty-eight horseshoe arches borne by thirty-two
octagonal piers, and the elaborate capitals are ornamented
with pine cones.</p>

<p>In the same district, near by, is the Sinagoga del Transito,
of similar style, erected about 1360. It was built at
the expense of one Samuel Levy, treasurer of Peter the
Cruel, who was afterward executed by order of his king.
The walls of the interior were decorated with Hebrew
writing, mainly passages from the Psalms. In 1492 this
synagogue was turned over to the Calatrava Order of
Knights, and many members of this order lie buried in
the body of the building. Later the synagogue was consecrated
to the death of the virgin.</p>

<p>Near these synagogues also was the Casa del Greco
(House of the Greek), so called because the famous
Greek painter, Dominico Theotocopuli, forerunner of the
impressionists, lived there. Among his pictures is a large
one of an "auto da fé" which took place in the main
square of the city, and the square when I saw it still
looked much the same as in the painting. The picture
shows the balconies of the houses surrounding the square
filled with eager and gay spectators who had come to witness
and enjoy the burning of Jewish heretics. They
must have assembled in about the same spirit as fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
people of a later day came to the bull fights. In the
picture the procession is entering the enclosure where are
seated the members of the Holy Office, or inquisitors, at
whose side stand the officers holding torches with which
to light the pyre on which the condemned victims were
bound. As I gazed at the square, I could graphically
visualize the scene portrayed in the picture. Such cruelty
and perversion inevitably presaged the spiritual as well
as the material decadence of the inhabitants of the Iberian
Peninsula.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>By the courtesy of Senator Pulido, I met and had
several conferences with the Marqués de Dosfuentes,
who several years before, as Fernando de Antón del
Olmet, had written an article entitled "La verdadera
patrio de Cristóbal Colón," which was published in "La
España Moderna," a leading monthly of Spain.</p>

<p>I was very much interested in the data that several
of the historians of Spain had unearthed regarding the
ancestry and place of origin of Columbus. The article by
the Marquis just mentioned was based on the research
made by Celso Garcia de la Riega, and both Olmet and
Riega came to the conclusion, based upon their examination
of records, that Columbus was not an Italian, but a
Spaniard, and that he was born in Pontevedra, Galicia,
in the northern part of Spain; that his father's name was
Colón (the Spanish for Columbus), and his mother's
name Fonterosa; and that he was of Jewish ancestry.</p>

<p>In his article Olmet says, after going into detail regarding
the nationality of Columbus according to the documents
which he was able to examine:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nothing seems more logical than the preceding reasoning,
and, moreover, this is the simplest method of explaining that
the Admiral's parents were a Colón and a Fonterosa, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
gives us a clue to the mystery of his life. From the document
under notice it is to be inferred that Domingo de Colón named
was a modest trader. If the admiral was his son, it would not
be absurd to suppose that, given the social prejudices of the
times, this should have been a sufficient motive for hiding his
origin and country. But there is still another reason that fully
justifies his secrecy and clears up all mystery. The patronymic
"Fonterosa" appears in the Province of Pontevedra connected
with the names of Jacob the elder, another Jacob, and Benjamin;
Colón's mother was called Susana. "If the admiral
belonged to this family, doubtless Jewish," says Sg. La Riega,
"since we may draw this inference from the Biblical names, or
if he belonged to a family of new Christians, should we not
forgive his action in the matter and declare him fully justified
in his resolution not to reveal such antecedents? We must bear
in mind the then existing hatred toward the Hebrew race and
the merciless fury let loose against it in the latter half of the
fifteenth century."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another part of the article Olmet says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Colón never mentioned any relative, paternal or maternal.
Even when Colón was at the zenith of his fame no one in Italy
came forward to claim relationship with him, although he was
the most famous personage of that time. Thus everything goes
to corroborate Don Fernando Colón's affirmation in his "Life
of the Admiral" that his father wished his origin and birthplace
to remain unknown.</p></blockquote>

<p>The research of La Riega was continued to 1914 and
published in that year. The author died early in the
year, shortly before I arrived in Madrid. Other Spanish
historians also have published conclusions similar to
those of La Riega. There was, for instance, a brochure by
Enrique de Arribas y Turull, entitled "Cristóbal Colón,
Natural de Pontevedra," which was originally delivered
as a lecture before the Madrid Historical Society. This
also sums up, in nineteen points, the reasons for the conclusion
that Columbus was a Spaniard, and of Jewish
ancestry.</p>

<p>Touring through Normandy late in July, 1914, we met
some friends who had just come from Paris who told us
that war was imminent and from best reports would
break out within a very few days. Accordingly we hurried
to Paris and in the course of twenty-four hours the whole
aspect of the city had changed. From the windows of our
hotel on the Place Vendôme and on the principal boulevards
of the city we saw youths of military age marching
to headquarters. The air throbbed with the <i>Marseillaise</i>.
Everywhere there were crowds, but they were neither
boisterous nor hilarious. Everywhere there was an air
of tension and determination, vastly unlike the usual
mood of jovial, happy Paris.</p>

<p>Starting at once for London, we found the trains so
overcrowded that it was impossible to get accommodations,
so we motored to Dieppe and reached there in time
to take the boat that left at three o'clock in the morning
for Newhaven. The ordinary capacity of the boat was
five hundred passengers, but it was packed from stem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
stern with some two thousand persons on this voyage,
mainly Americans. The Calais-Dover crossing of the
Channel had already been suspended.</p>

<p>On board the train from Newhaven to London, a curious
incident occurred that indicated the derangement of
things. I had four fares to pay, amounting to about three
pounds. I handed the conductor a five-pound Bank of
England note. He took it, but shortly returned with it,
saying he could accept nothing but gold. I expostulated
with him, told him I had no gold, and since a bank note
was valid tender I insisted upon its acceptance. But the
upshot was that he preferred to take my card with my
London address!</p>

<p>It would appear that my credit at that moment was
better than that of the Bank of England.</p>

<p>We arrived in London on Sunday, August 2d. At the
Hyde Park Hotel, to which we went, a typewritten
notice was posted announcing a meeting on the following
day at the Waldorf Hotel on the Strand. The persons who
signed the notice were unknown to me, and at first I was
inclined to pay no attention to it. However, I did go, and
found gathered inside and in front of the hotel several
thousand stranded Americans. The main hall and all
approaches to it were packed. Several persons in the
crowd recognized me and made a passageway so that I
could get into the room where the meeting was being
held. Upon my entrance I was lifted upon a table that
served as a platform, and was asked to speak. I made a
short address to the panic-stricken assembly, assured them
they had nothing to fear and were as safe in London as if
they were in New York, and that our committee would
remain with them and help them get suitable transportation
as early as practicable. There was loud cheering and
my words seemed to have a comforting effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>Immediately thereafter a group of us came together
and organized a special committee for the aid of Americans
in Europe. There were Frederick I. Kent, one of the
vice-presidents of the Bankers' Trust Company; W. N.
Duane, another vice-president of the Bankers' Trust
Company; Theodore Hetzler, a vice-president of the
Fifth Avenue Bank; Joseph P. Day, a prominent real
estate auctioneer of New York City; William C. Breed,
an officer of the Merchants' Association; Chandler P.
Anderson and James Byrne, prominent American lawyers,
several others, and myself. We arranged for headquarters
at the Hotel Savoy, where several of the largest
salons were placed at our disposal so that we had room
for the various departments that needed to be formed to
attend to the wants of the many terrified Americans who
were pouring into London from all over the Continent.
Mr. Hetzler was chairman of the general committee, Mr.
Duane secretary, and Robert W. DeForest, vice-president
of the American Red Cross, was member <i>ex-officio</i>.
I was made chairman of the embassy committee of which
Ambassador Page was honorary chairman, and the American
ambassadors to France, Germany, Austria, and the
ministers to Holland and Belgium were made advisory
members. We found many willing helpers, including a
number of professors from American universities and
other public-spirited men and women.</p>

<p>The necessary sub-committees were speedily formed:
Mr. Day was made chairman of the transportation committee
and got in touch with the managers of all the
transatlantic steamship companies. Mr. Kent was chairman
of the finance committee, and through his banking
connections was able to get a limited amount of gold to
advance to those who could not convert their foreign
money, notwithstanding the moratorium that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
declared which made it impossible for several days to get
ready money; foreign bills were not being accepted by
the banks. With the declaration of the moratorium we
at once called a meeting of the managers of the hotels
where most of the Americans were stopping, and without
exception these men were very accommodating. They
agreed not to require payment from their American
guests for the time being, and as far as possible to advance
them a little money to meet their immediate requirements.</p>

<p>Our embassy was crowded from morning to night with
hundreds of citizens, most of whom wanted to make application
for passports, for the steamship companies required
the exhibition of passports before arranging for
transportation. The rooms at the embassy were not
large enough to accommodate the crowds that filled
them, so we transferred the passport division to the Hotel
Savoy, and Ambassador Page assigned to me several clerks
to facilitate the handling of our business. I am sorry to
say there was a tendency on the part of many American
travelers to find fault with our ambassador and the embassy.
This was not at all justified, and I took every occasion
to assure them that the ambassador was doing all
in his power with his limited staff, and that our committee
had his fullest coöperation and was getting his aid in
every possible way. I consulted with Ambassador Page
almost every day, and together we planned for arranging
for money and the many other requirements of our citizens.</p>

<p>In those first hectic days, some of us worked all day
and far into the night, or rather into the next morning.
Many British friends who visited our rooms marveled at
the promptness and efficiency with which we dispatched
business under the circumstances, and were solicitous for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the health of "the unofficial ambassador," as I was being
called, and his staff.</p>

<p>After the committee had been going a few days, it secured
the coöperation of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover.
He was chairman of an American benevolent society, of
the woman's committee of which Mrs. Hoover was at
the head. As the members of our relief committee returned
home, the work was by degrees turned over to Mr.
and Mrs. Hoover and their associates, until by August
27th we put all of the remaining work and funds into the
hands of their society.</p>

<p>One day Earl Grey paid me a visit at our headquarters,
and with him was Mrs. Waldorf Astor, now Viscountess
Astor, who reminded me that "all work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy," and insisted that Mrs. Straus and I
spend the week-end at Cliveden, their residence, a short
distance by rail out of London. Other guests were Earl
Grey, Geoffrey Robinson, editor of the London "Times,"
and several others connected with the editorship of "The
Round Table," a political quarterly.</p>

<p>Mr. Waldorf Astor was an earnest, modest young man,
then about thirty-four years old, unspoiled by his enormous
wealth. On the contrary, he was and still is devoting
much of his wealth as well as his parliamentary activities
to philanthropic work, including the treatment and
prevention of tuberculosis, and in this connection had
been in touch with my brother Nathan in regard to milk
pasteurization.</p>

<p>There were several subsequent week-ends at Cliveden.
On one of these visits, a dozen or more young men were
there, members of England's foremost families. They
enjoyed themselves at tennis and other games and on
Monday were to join the colors. It is sad to record that
most of these fine fellows, with the exception of two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
three, were killed or seriously wounded within the next
few months.</p>

<p>When England entered the war, the diplomatic correspondence
was published in what was called the British
"White Paper." Sir Edward Grey, now Viscount Grey,
had made a speech in Parliament, of which I read the
published version in this "White Paper." It happened
that on that very day Earl Grey, cousin to Sir Edward,
was lunching with me at my hotel, and I took the occasion
to point out to him the necessity of making clear,
especially for the American public, that the reason England
had joined the Allies was not only on Belgium's
account, but to uphold the sanctity of international obligations.
This concerned not alone the belligerent nations,
but all the nations. Without the sanctity of international
obligations the war, no matter how it ended, would cause
a reversion to a state of international barbarity. Earl
Grey suggested that I discuss the subject with his cousin,
and arranged for a meeting. A few days later we three sat
down to a simple and informal luncheon at Earl Grey's
home on South Street, in Park Lane.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey spoke earnestly and frankly. He felt
the great responsibility of the decision that brought
England into the war, and said he had often asked himself
whether he could have done otherwise. There was
nothing chauvinistic in either his attitude or his arguments.
It was plain that he had weighed the entire
issue carefully. His open-mindedness, his simplicity and
straightforwardness of manner, his great ability and
humanitarian zeal, impressed me very much.</p>

<p>I called his attention to the importance of having
Russia grant civil and religious rights to her subject
nationalities; the failure of such action would weaken
the moral cause of the Allies, and also from an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
point of view it was important that Russia give some
evidence of a liberal spirit, otherwise it might be feared
that victory for the Allies would redound mainly to the
advantage of autocracy in Russia. I contended that it
was not a question of humanity, but plain state policy,
and that it was important that the Governments of Great
Britain and France bring Russia, as their ally, into line.
I had received several cables from prominent men in New
York and Boston who had thus expressed the American
point of view.</p>

<p>The conversation ran on for an hour and a half in a very
informal way. Earl Grey then made the suggestion, in
accordance with my remarks of a few days before about
the necessity of making clear England's position in entering
the war, that I give out an interview to the American
press covering the substance of our conversation. I
demurred. Naturally I hesitated to state publicly the
delicate and critical questions that the British Minister
of Foreign Affairs had so frankly discussed with me.
However, Sir Edward himself said he would appreciate
my doing so, for he had perfect confidence in my doing
it without embarrassment to his country. I therefore
agreed to it, with the proviso that he approve the interview
before it was released for publication.</p>

<p>I got in touch with the representatives of the American
papers in London and that evening gave out the interview.
The next morning I sent a copy to Sir Edward,
who returned it to me without a single change, saying he
approved both its form and content. The matter was
then cabled to America, published in our leading papers
on August 15th, and cabled back for republication in the
British papers.</p>

<p>Thereafter the London papers came to me for further
interviews, and in a subsequent statement I dwelt more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
specifically on the importance of Russia's fair treatment
of her subject nationalities, particularly the Jews, who
had suffered most. The press representatives asked
whether they might show my interview to Lord Weardale
and if possible get his comment, to which I gladly
consented.</p>

<p>Lord Weardale had been head of the Parliamentary
deputation that visited Russia the year before and had
an intimate knowledge of Russian conditions. He told me
later that he had already written the Russian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Sazonoff, along the identical lines of
my interview. He supplemented what I had stated, with
an interview, saying, among other things:</p>

<blockquote><p>It would be an immense step in the path of progress of Russia
herself and would create a profound sentiment of satisfaction
in the civilized world if the Tsar at such a juncture were to give
emphatic endorsement to his already declared intention to give
full religious liberty to all his peoples. It is not enough to be
powerful in the battlefield; it is even more important to conquer
the approval of the human conscience.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Government and people of Great Britain were
very solicitous at that time regarding public opinion in
America and the probable attitude of our Government.
In many quarters there was a feeling of uncertainty and
even of misgiving toward the statement by President
Wilson respecting an offer of mediation at the opportune
moment, in accordance with the provisions of the Hague
Treaty. Because of this and other considerations, Sir
Edward Grey and others recognized the importance
of having Russia give evidence of a more enlightened
spirit.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We left London at the end of August, and upon arrival
home went up to Hartsdale, a short distance out of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
York, to visit with our son. A few days afterward Mr.
James Speyer, whose summer home was but a few miles
distant, at Scarboro, telephoned, inviting Mrs. Straus
and myself to dine with him. Mrs. Speyer had not
returned from abroad; the guests were Mr. and Mrs.
Frank A. Vanderlip and Count von Bernstorff. As Mrs.
Straus was rather worn out by her London experience,
I went alone. There were several other neighbors,
Mr. Frank H. Platt and Mr. Frank Trumbull and perhaps
one other, about eight of us, of whom Mrs. Vanderlip
was the only lady.</p>

<p>Bernstorff I had known for a number of years. I had
first met him in 1888 when I was on my first mission to
Turkey and he was attaché of the German embassy.
Later he came to Washington as ambassador when I was
in the Cabinet, and we met frequently there.</p>

<p>The conversation at dinner was general, although it
was inevitable that we discuss the war. Bernstorff voiced
the usual claim of the Germans, that they did not want
war, and that the Kaiser and the German Government
stood for peace. When he had dilated upon that theme I
asked him:</p>

<p>"Is that the present sentiment and attitude of your
country?"</p>

<p>He replied that it certainly was when he left Berlin
only two weeks before, on returning to America from his
leave of absence.</p>

<p>Knowing how anxious President Wilson was to use any
proper opportunity that might present itself for ending
the war, I asked Bernstorff whether his Government
would entertain a proposition for mediation.</p>

<p>He answered me promptly: "Speaking for myself, I
certainly would entertain such a proposition." But he
added that he could not speak officially, since cable communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
with his Government had been cut off for a
week or more.</p>

<p>I asked him whether in his opinion his Government
would give favorable consideration to such a proposal.
He said that before leaving Berlin he had discussed with
the Chancellor the possibility of mediation, following
the report of President Wilson's statement that he was
ready to offer his services as mediator to both parties, and
the Chancellor had said that the war had but begun and
it was too early to instruct regarding mediation until the
offer was presented. On my questioning him further, the
ambassador said his personal opinion was that his Government
would accept an offer of mediation. I remarked
that I could not but regard his statement as significant,
and asked him if I might use it in such a manner as I saw
fit. He replied that he had no objection.</p>

<p>As we rose from the table, I made sure of my understanding
of his statements, and then the thought occurred
to me that the best thing to do was to report the conversation
to Secretary of State Bryan, so that he might, if
he saw fit, bring it before the President. I so informed
Bernstorff, and again he told me he had no objection.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It was ten-fifteen. I announced
that I would go to Washington on the midnight train.
My host suggested that I "sleep on it and don't hurry";
but I concluded that if there was anything I could do to
shorten the war by even a few hours I would have to charge
myself with neglect of duty if on account of personal
convenience I had refrained from doing so. The next day
was Sunday; the day after was Labor Day; and all the
while thousands were falling on the battlefield. Several
of the guests agreed with my decision, so I bade them
good-night, called my motor, and caught the midnight
train for Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>Sunday morning I telephoned to Mr. Bryan at once
and made an appointment to meet him at his home. I
repeated my conversation with Bernstorff precisely as it
had occurred, and Bryan believed, as I did, that it might
pave the way to mediation. I suggested that he have the
German ambassador come to Washington and speak with
him. He communicated with the German embassy, and
Bernstorff arrived the following morning.</p>

<p>Bryan presented the subject to the President, who expressed
himself as pleased with the possibility of a favorable
outcome. The Secretary advised me to have a
conference with the British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,
and with the French ambassador, M. Jusserand.
He had already informed them what had taken place and
of my presence in Washington. Sir Cecil asked whether
I would kindly come to the embassy, and I replied I
would do so, and suggested that he arrange to have the
French ambassador also present. This he did.</p>

<p>When I reached the embassy, M. Jusserand had not
yet arrived, and Sir Cecil and I indulged in reminiscences.
He too had been in Constantinople during my first mission,
as secretary of the British embassy. Soon we were
joined by M. Jusserand, whom also I had known well for
many years, for he had been in Washington since 1902,
and I had seen much of him during my Cabinet days.</p>

<p>When we took up the proposal regarding which we had
come together, both of these gentlemen agreed that it was
deserving of serious attention, but Sir Cecil had little
confidence in Bernstorff, who had been his colleague at
Cairo, where they had represented their respective Governments.
He asked whether I thought an ambassador
would make such a statement as Bernstorff's without
authority from his Government. I replied that both he
and M. Jusserand were better qualified to answer that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
question, upon which M. Jusserand said that he knew
that no ambassador under the German system would dare
make such remarks without previous authority from his
Government.</p>

<p>"That is so much the better," I commented.</p>

<p>Sir Cecil declared that German diplomacy was peculiar
and that the Foreign Office had no conscience in disavowing
statements by its ambassadors if it suited Germany's
purpose.</p>

<p>After we had gone over the whole subject, both ambassadors
stated that if it held one chance in a hundred
of shortening the war, it was their duty to entertain it.
I replied that I hoped they would entertain it cordially.</p>

<p>Jusserand in his usual happy manner said, "'Cordially,'
that is a little too strong."</p>

<p>"Well, sympathetically, then," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sympathetically, yes." And with that we parted,
both ambassadors expressing their thanks and appreciation
of my services.</p>

<p>I had been scrupulously careful to be absolutely accurate
in all my statements, and it was therefore gratifying,
after the Bryan-Bernstorff conference, to have the
Secretary tell me that the ambassador's report of the
Scarboro incident was in every detail in accord with mine,
and to have the ambassador also confirm the correctness
of Mr. Bryan's understanding from my report. Naturally
I was anxious to avoid misunderstandings or misconceptions
of any kind. The issue was too important.</p>

<p>Both Secretary Bryan and Ambassador Bernstorff
cabled to Berlin, and for the time the subject rested there.
My remaining in Washington was unnecessary, and I
returned to New York. But before leaving, I called by
appointment at both the French and British embassies,
which also had communicated events in detail to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Governments. Both ambassadors expressed their high
appreciation for my services and hoped I would keep in
close touch with them regarding the matter, both for
their sake and for the sake of our respective Governments.
I told them I would regard myself as "messenger boy"
for mediation. Sir Cecil replied, "Ambassador extraordinary."
He promised to keep me informed, and two
days later wrote me:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have not yet received any intimation from my Government,
nor do I expect one unless something definite is before
them. But I need not tell you how heartily my sympathy is
with your humanitarian efforts, and you know Grey well
enough to be sure that, while scrupulously faithful to all his
engagements, he will do everything possible in the cause of
peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Throughout these negotiations we took great care to
keep the matter secret. Despite that fact it leaked out in
some way, and the correspondent of the London "Times"
reported it in such a way as to give the impression that
I had been duped by the wily German ambassador; and
there were one or two other papers which took that view.
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice was incensed at this interpretation
and wrote me on October 3d:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am sure no one who knows you and knows the facts would
ever think that you were either duped or the secret agent of
Germany. I am quite positive that Sir Edward Grey would
never have such an idea. What you did&mdash;and what I hope you
will continue to do&mdash;is a work of pure philanthropy.</p></blockquote>

<p>On October 15th he wrote me again on this subject,
saying that when the London "Times" representative
returned to Washington from New York, he would set
him right as to the facts with a view to having the report
corrected, and adding:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>We used to say at school, "Blessed are the peace makers, for
they get more kicks than half-pence!" It represents a melancholy
truth, but, however, I am sure every well-thinking person
must appreciate your beneficent efforts.</p></blockquote>

<p>But in general the press of Great Britain expressed its
appreciation of the services I had rendered in lifting the
latch of the door to mediation.</p>

<p>A letter from Sir Edward Grey concerning the negotiations
sheds important light upon the British attitude:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Foreign Office, London, S.W.</span><br />
<i>Saturday</i>, 26 <i>September</i>, 1914
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter of the 9th. I am so busy that I
have not time to write at any length; but do not let that make
you suppose that I am out of sympathy with what you say.</p>

<p>First of all, however, we must save ourselves and the West
of Europe, before we can exercise any influence elsewhere. The
Prussian military caste has dominated Germany, and the whole
of the West of Europe is in danger of being dominated by it.
The German Government, in the hands of this military caste,
prepared this war, planned it, and chose the time for it. We
know now that the war has revealed how thoroughly the German
preparations had been made beforehand: with an organization
and forethought which is wonderful, and would have
been admirable had it been devoted to a praiseworthy purpose.
Not one of the other nations now fighting against Germany
is prepared in the same way.</p>

<p>Now, we wish to have three things: Firstly, to secure our own
liberty as independent States, who will live and let live on equal
terms; secondly, the establishment somehow of a Germany not
dominated by a military caste; a nation who will look at liberty
and politics from the same point of view as we do, and who
will deal with us on equal terms and in good faith; thirdly,
reparation for the cruel wrongs done to Belgium; to get that is
a matter of honour and justice and right.</p>

<p>The statements made by Wolff's Bureau in Europe deny that
Germany is yet ready for peace. If she is ready for peace, then
I think that her ambassador in Washington ought not to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
about the bush. He ought to make it clear to President Wilson
that he is authorized to speak on behalf of his Government; and
state to the President that Germany does wish to make peace.
In that case, President Wilson could approach all the others
who are engaged in this war and bring them into consultation
with one another and with him. But at present we have no
indication that Germany wishes to have peace, and no indication
that she would agree to any terms that would give reparation
to Belgium and security to the rest of Europe that the
peace would be durable.</p>

<p class="center">
Yours very truly</p>
<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">E. Grey</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The history of those negotiations is presented somewhat
at length because my friend of many years, the late
Ambassador Page, in his recently published letters also
expressed the feeling that I had been used as a dupe to
throw the blame for continuing the war upon Great
Britain, though he expressed great confidence in me and
friendship for me. I may say I was not unmindful of
this contingency; but I felt that if the negotiations did
not result as we hoped, they would serve to expose the insincerity
of the German Government with regard to its
peace professions. And this is precisely what happened,
as the answer of the German Chancellor, received by the
State Department on September 22d, confirms:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Imperial Chancellor is much obliged for America's
offer. Germany did not want war, it was forced upon her.
Even after we shall have defeated France we shall still have to
face England and Russia. England, France, and Russia have
signed a convention to make peace solely in mutual agreement
with each other. England, that is, Mr. Asquith, the London
Times, and English diplomatic officers, have on various occasions
... [sic] that England is determined to conduct the war
to the utmost and that she expects success from it lasting a long
time. It is therefore up to the United States to get our enemies
to make peace proposals. Germany can only accept the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
which promises to be a real and lasting peace and will protect
her against any new attacks from her enemies. If we accepted
America's offer of mediation now our enemies would interpret it
as a sign of weakness and the German people would not understand
it. For the nation which has been willing to make such
sacrifices has a right to demand that there shall be guarantees
of rest and security.</p></blockquote>

<p>Secretary Bryan, in his instruction to Ambassador
Page on September 8th, had anticipated Germany's
refusal to accept mediation. The instruction concluded:</p>

<blockquote><p>We do not know, of course, what reply the German Emperor
will make, but this war is so horrible from every aspect that no
one can afford to take the responsibility for continuing it implacably.
The British and French ambassadors fear that Germany
will not accept any reasonable terms, but even a failure to
agree will not rob an attempt at mediation of all its advantages
because the different nations would be able to explain to the
world their attitude, the reasons for continuing the war, the end
to be hoped for and the terms upon which peace is possible.
This would locate the responsibility for the continuance of the
war and help to mould public opinion. Will notify you as soon
as answer is received from Bernstorff.</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 29th all the British papers served by the
Central News War Service carried a cable from New York
detailing the negotiations, which ended:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is believed by those concerned that an important step has
been taken to pave the way for mediation, when the opportune
moment arrives. In other words, the bolt on the door of mediation
has been thrown back so that it will be possible for the door
to be opened without either side being forced to take the initiative.
Time will doubtless show that the initiative so fortuitously
taken by Mr. Straus will prove of real service in the interests of
ultimate peace negotiations, and any endeavors to deprecate
those services as having been made in Germany's interests are
not only contrary to all the facts, but are most unfortunate.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>: The censor does not object to the publication of the
foregoing details, but insists that publication should be accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
by a footnote pointing out that since these occurrences
took place the German Government have disavowed
their ambassador.</p></blockquote>

<p>Had Germany's oft-reiterated peace professions been
sincere, she would have accepted this offer for mediation.
By her refusal the falsity of her professions was exposed
not only in Great Britain and in our own country, but
in all the neutral countries; and the <i>exposé</i> served as
added proof to all peace-loving and neutrally-minded
persons that the responsibility for the war and its continuance
rested upon the German Government.</p>

<p>In America many of us continued to hope that some
way might be found to bring the representatives of the
warring nations into a conference, thereby removing misunderstanding
and misconception and paving the way
for an early peace. On December 31st the New York
representative of the Central News of London asked
several Americans to write New Year's messages to the
warring nations of Europe, to be cabled to all the chief
newspapers of the continent. Messages were given by
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, Andrew Carnegie, Bishop
David Greer, and myself, and they were all substantially
of the same tenor, as a passage from each will show:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Bishop Greer</i>: It is the earnest hope and prayer of all Christian
people in America that the awful and deplorable war now
raging may soon reach an end which will insure lasting peace
and one satisfactory in character to all the nations involved.</p>

<p><i>Andrew Carnegie</i>: I am convinced that the next effort of
lovers of peace should be to concentrate the world over in demanding
that this unparalleled slaughter of man by man shall
be the last war waged by civilized nations for the settlement of
international disputes. War dethroned&mdash;Peace enthroned.</p>

<p><i>President Butler</i>: May it be in America's fortunate lot to
bind up the wounds of the war and to set the feet of her sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
nations once more in the paths of peace, international good-will
and constructive statesmanship.</p>

<p>I said: For the past five months each of the nations has been
seeking victory in the trenches of death; but it has not been
found there. Only through wise counsels can the victory of
permanent peace be obtained. President Wilson and His Holiness
the Pope have offered their offices to open the door of
mediation. Will not the Kaiser and King George give the mandate
so that the door may be opened and this delusion be dispelled,
thereby earning the blessings of a bleeding and suffering
world?</p></blockquote>

<p>These statements are cited as evidence of how slowly
we in America came to realize the ruthless designs for
conquest which the German militarists had prepared and
fostered for forty years, not only strategically, but even
in shaping the psychology of the child in school and the
man in the street to conform to their design.</p>

<p>For a year or more events marched on, tragically, like
a malignant disease. On February 2, 1917, I lunched with
Roosevelt at the Hotel Langdon, on Fifth Avenue and
Fifty-Sixth Street, where Roosevelt was in the habit of
stopping when in New York. The German Government
two days before had announced her submarine blockade
of the British, French, and Dutch coasts, and our own
entrance into the war seemed likely.</p>

<p>We were discussing the crisis, and Roosevelt said he did
not think we should be involved; the President would
probably find some way out and arrange to have Germany's
pledge, not to destroy merchant ships of neutrals
or belligerents without warning, whittled down so as to
apply only to ships flying the American flag. He told us
that he had engaged passage on one of the United Fruit
Company steamers to Jamaica for Mrs. Roosevelt and
himself. Mrs. Roosevelt needed a change, and they would
start in a few days. Regarding the war, he could do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
more. He had done all he could. He had made an offer
to the Secretary of War to raise a division, and had a
whole card catalogue of names of men who had volunteered
to serve in it.</p>

<p>His relations with the President were far from friendly.
He had violently criticized him in articles contributed to
the "Metropolitan Magazine" and in several public addresses
had urged preparedness and compulsory military
training. I asked him, in view of the German blockade,
what he would do if he were President. He said he would
promptly assemble our fleet, put marines on the interned
German ships, and show Germany that we were in dead
earnest; that unless she recalled her decision to sink
merchant ships without observing the rules of modern
warfare we should take immediate steps to protect our
rights.</p>

<p>"If we continue to back down we will become Chinafied,
without any rights that other nations will respect,"
said Roosevelt emphatically.</p>

<p>In such critical times, personal differences might be
laid aside, I suggested, and I wanted him to write the
President and let him have the benefit of his views. I
went further: I suggested that I could write the President
about it. But in Roosevelt's opinion, Wilson would conclude
that Roosevelt had himself urged me to do this
because of my close association with Roosevelt.</p>

<p>My own relations with the President were always agreeable,
I might even say most friendly. He had written me
sometime before, that he would consider it a favor if I
would keep him informed of developments that came
under my observation regarding important matters. It
occurred to me that on the eve of war it would be a fine
thing if he consulted with his two surviving predecessors,
as Monroe had done in consulting with Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
and Madison before issuing the doctrine which bears his
name. In the crisis we were facing such a step would allay
partisan differences and serve to solidify the Nation.
With these ideas in mind I sent the President the following
telegram:</p>

<blockquote><p>Every patriotic American should support you in this great
crisis in the history of our country. May I suggest the course
followed by Monroe under a crisis involving many of the same
principles, to confer with the two surviving ex-Presidents,
whose advice, I feel sure, will be most helpful and serve to
patriotically solidify the country behind you?</p></blockquote>

<p>I informed Roosevelt of my action. He felt sure the
President wanted neither advice nor cooperation, though
he himself was ready to give him the fullest coöperation
should Wilson desire it. He thought the same was true on
the part of Mr. Taft. The telegram, to my surprise, was
given out at Washington to the press a day or two later,
but nothing ever came of it.</p>

<p>On February 7th the country was more or less agreeably
surprised by the fact that Count von Bernstorff had
been given his passports and Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin had been instructed to demand his. I say the
country was surprised because the President had so long
delayed and avoided such a step&mdash;even after the sinking
of the Lusitania and the Sussex following his "strict accountability"
and other strong statements&mdash;that it was
generally believed he did not mean to take it.</p>

<p>Roosevelt, of course, thought that we should have
taken such action long before. His contention was always
that had we taken prompt and decisive steps after the
Lusitania tragedy, we should have been spared the submarine
invasions. In fact, he thought we should have
acted when Germany announced her submarine blockade
and possibly saved ourselves from the Lusitania horror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Now that diplomatic relations were broken off, he canceled
his trip to Jamaica, not wishing to be out of the
country when war was likely to be declared at any moment.</p>

<p>At about this time the impression was current that the
Jews of America were anti-Ally, a fact that had a prejudicial
effect in France and England. It probably grew out
of the fact that three of the largest Jewish banking houses
of the country were of German origin, and further that
the Yiddish press was anti-Russian in its sympathies as a
result of the treatment of Jews in Russia.</p>

<p>After a careful investigation of these reports, a group
of us met at the home of Eugene Meyer, Jr., later chairman
of the War Finance Corporation. Among those I
recall at this meeting were: Fabian Franklin, of the "New
York Evening Post"; George L. Beer, the historian;
Rabbi Stephen S. Wise; Professor Richard Gottheil, of
Columbia University. M. Stephane Lauzanne, editor of
"Le Matin" of Paris, and Professor Henri Bergson, both
of whom were then in New York, had also been consulted.
It was decided that the most practical way of correcting
this erroneous impression was for me to write to the
French and British ambassadors at Washington.</p>

<p>Accordingly I wrote to Ambassadors Spring-Rice and
Jusserand that the impression was unfounded, that our
investigations and observations showed a large preponderance
of pro-Ally sympathy among the Jews, and I cited
a number of leading citizens in business and the various
professions, who were representative of their class, whom
I knew personally to be pro-Ally. I stated further that in
one of the largest Jewish clubs, whose membership consisted
almost entirely of Jews of German origin, the pro-Ally
sentiment was so strong as to be practically unanimous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>The ambassadors were grateful for this information,
which they communicated to their Governments; and
through the agency of M. Lauzanne and with the consent
of the ambassadors, the letters were given in full to the
French and British press.</p>

<p>On the very day that Congress declared war against
Germany, April 6, 1917, we were giving a dinner at our
home to Professor Henri Bergson. Among our guests
were James M. Beck, author of "The Evidence in the
Case" and "The War and Humanity"; ex-Senator Burton
of Ohio; former Governor and Mrs. John M. Slaton,
of Georgia; Adolph S. Ochs, of the "New York Times,"
and Mrs. Ochs. Bergson was regarded as the unofficial
representative of France in our country at the time. Of
course, our thoughts and conversation were dominated
by the great event of the day. Professor Bergson and Mr.
Beck drank and responded to toasts with eloquent fervor.
It was felt by all that the entrance into the war of the
United States would prove a decided factor in winning it
for democracy and constitutional liberty.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Just before Christmas, 1918&mdash;to be specific, on December
22d&mdash;I called on Roosevelt at the Roosevelt
Hospital, where he was convalescing from his seven weeks'
illness, believed to have been inflammatory rheumatism.
He was dressed in his <i>robe de chambre</i> and was seated in an
armchair with a pile of books before him. He looked neither
enfeebled nor emaciated, though he showed signs of
illness. When I asked him how he had been since my last
visit, for I had called on him frequently during his illness,
he told me that he had had an attack of embolism&mdash;I
think that was the ailment&mdash;which showed in his
wrists, and that his fever had gone up to 104. But that
was all gone and he was again feeling fine. He was planning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
to return to Sagamore Hill to spend Christmas,
which he subsequently did.</p>

<p>He inquired particularly about my son Roger, of whom
he was very fond, and who was then in Siberia, where he
had served for some months as captain and assistant intelligence
officer on the staff of General William S. Graves,
in command of the American Expeditionary Forces. I
told him we had had a cable from Roger from Blagoveschensk
that he was well. In his last letter he had expressed
a desire to come home, since the war was over.
Roosevelt agreed that that was right. He would not want
his own sons to endanger their lives in the civil war raging
in Russia, and he would not have Roger do so. "Let the
Russians settle their own internal affairs; that is not our
business," he added.</p>

<p>By way of amusing and interesting Roosevelt, I told
him of a curious incident narrated in one of Roger's letters.
He had been sent as the official representative of the
army into the Amur Province, of which the governor was
Alexandre Alexiefsky, who had been a member of the
Constitutional Assembly of the Kerensky Government.
When Roger called, the governor repeated his name familiarly
and then asked: "Are you related to His Excellency
by that name in the Cabinet of President Roosevelt?"
When Roger told him he was my son, the governor immediately
expressed a readiness to help him in every possible
way, because as the latter said he owed his life to
me. As Roger expressed it, "He was courteous before,
but after that he was ready to give me his undershirt."</p>

<span class="caption">ROGER W. STRAUS <br />
First Lieutenant, afterwards Captain, on the Staff of General W. S.
Graves, American Expeditionary Force in Siberia. Now Major in the
Reserve Corps, U. S. A."</span>
</div>

<p>Alexiefsky had told Roger the story of his case. In the
autumn of 1908, several Russians whom the Czar had
exiled to Siberia as political prisoners made their escape
and came to the United States. The Russian Government
discovered this and engaged one of the leading New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
York law firms to secure the extradition of the refugees,
which was demanded on the specious charge of murder.
Secretary Root, in the midst of his many important duties,
favored the extradition, and the papers were referred
by the State Department to Attorney-General Bonaparte.
Application for deportation was also made to me under
the immigration laws.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several prominent men and women interested
in the case&mdash;Miss Lillian Wald, of the Henry Street
Settlement House, New York, and James Bronson Reynolds,
chairman of the American Society for Russian
Freedom, foremost among these&mdash;supplied the intelligence
and the proof that these men were not criminals in
any sense, but political refugees. When Roosevelt spoke
to me about them, I told him that I had declined to deport
them because it was clear to me that they were
political refugees. At that moment Bonaparte joined us.
Roosevelt requested him to return the papers in the case,
and shortly directed that the men were not to be deported.</p>

<p>Roosevelt said he vividly recalled all this. His face
beamed as he said: "Is n't that fine! Very fine! I'm
delighted to hear it!"</p>

<p>"You did that," I said to him; "without your sustaining
me these men would have been either extradited or
deported, which would have meant death."</p>

<p>"Both of us did it; it's fine! I'm delighted to hear it,"
he commented, his face glowing with its usual vivacity.</p>

<p>The next day Roosevelt left the hospital to return to
his home in Oyster Bay. He apparently gave every indication
that soon he would be entirely well again and be
with us for many years. Certainly that is what we all
expected. He was only sixty.</p>

<p>Exactly two weeks later, on January 6, 1919, I received
a telephone call at seven o'clock in the morning from Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Striker, secretary to Mr. Roosevelt, announcing that he
had died early that morning. For thirteen years or more
he had had a large and affectionate share in our lives and
thoughts, and Mrs. Straus and I felt as though we had
been stricken with the loss of a member of our immediate
family. I can truly say that I never had a more loyal or a
dearer friend. He always treated me and mine as if we
were among his nearest relatives.</p>

<p>On January 8th my wife, my son's wife, and I motored
to Oyster Bay to attend the funeral in the little Episcopal
Church. It had been Roosevelt's wish that he be buried
from the little church that was the place of worship of his
family. The building held only about three hundred and
fifty persons, so that none but his family and close friends
could be present. There was a committee from the United
States Senate headed by Vice-President Marshall; a committee
from the House; several former members of the
Cabinet&mdash;Elihu Root, Truman H. Newberry, Henry
L. Stimson, James R. Garfield, Mrs. Garfield, ex-President
Taft, Governor Hughes. William Loeb, Jr., and
Captain Archie Roosevelt were ushers. The other sons,
Theodore and Kermit, were still in France. The church
was filled with a company of sincere friends and bereaved
mourners. The regular Episcopal service was begun at
twelve-forty-five, and lasted about twenty-five minutes,
when we all accompanied the body to the little cemetery
on the side of the hill half a mile away.</p>

<p>Hardly a day passes without its scores of pilgrims to
that grave. They come from near and far. Many lay
flowers on the grave. On holidays and Sundays they come
by the hundreds. Two years ago the intimate friends of
Roosevelt, who had been officially or personally associated
with him, formed the Roosevelt Pilgrimage, an association
whose purpose is to keep alive the ideals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
personality of Theodore Roosevelt by an annual visit to
his grave and a simple ceremony. The idea and organization
originated with Mr. E. A. Van Valkenburg of
the Philadelphia "North American." On January 6, 1922,
some sixty persons made the pilgrimage, headed by Dr.
Lyman Abbott, permanent chairman of the association.
James R. Garfield read Roosevelt's Nobel Peace Prize
address, delivered in Christiania in 1910, at the conclusion
of which some wreaths were laid on the grave. Mrs.
Roosevelt invited us all to luncheon, and the old-time
hospitality and friendliness of the Roosevelt home brought
many memories of our departed leader.</p>

<p>After luncheon the annual meeting of the Pilgrimage
took place in the great North Room, where Roosevelt had
so often received his friends and guests. Dr. Abbott made
a brief and feeling address, and Mrs. Richard Derby
(Ethel Roosevelt) read from original manuscript Roosevelt's
proclamation of 1912 which called into being the
Progressive Party. Hermann Hagedorn read a poem
entitled "The Deacon's Prayer," by Samuel Valentine
Cole, which had especially appealed to Roosevelt. The
last stanza of this poem is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">
"We want a man whom we can trust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To lead us where thy purpose leads;</span><br />
Who dares not lie, but dares be just&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give us the dangerous man of deeds!"</span><br />
So prayed the deacon, letting fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each sentence from his heart; and when</span><br />
He took his seat the brethren all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As by one impulse, cried, "Amen!"</span>

<p>Now that the curtain of armistice had descended upon
the world's most devastating war, the League to Enforce
Peace was endeavoring to coöperate in every possible way
with President Wilson and the official delegates to the
Peace Conference, and with similar organizations in
Europe, to bring into existence a League of Nations.</p>

<p>I had been made chairman of the overseas committee,
and on the afternoon of Theodore Roosevelt's funeral,
former President Taft and I met to confer regarding
the work to be done. Both of us were very much depressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
by the death of our friend. Taft felt grateful that
"Theodore" (as he always called Roosevelt) and he had
some months earlier reëstablished their long-time former
friendship, which had unhappily been interrupted by
political events.</p>

<p>Mr. Taft courteously told me that he was glad that I
was going to Paris, and that he believed I might render a
great service in helping to secure an effective League of
Nations. He hoped I would have conferences with Balfour,
Lloyd George, and Léon Bourgeois, and that I would
be able to show them what kind of a League we, and as
we thought, the American public generally, wanted. At
my request, Taft agreed to write me a letter, signed by
himself as president of the League to Enforce Peace, and
by A. Lawrence Lowell, chairman of the Executive Committee,
giving me full authority to take whatever action
in Europe I might consider wise. I told Taft that I
wanted a letter which should expressly state, among
other things, that I was to support our official delegates,
as it would not do for America to show a divided front.
He told me, what I also had known from conversations
with Roosevelt, that Roosevelt had latterly expressed
himself in favor of such a League of Nations as we stood
for. I reminded Taft that Roosevelt had been the first
in recent years to emphasize the subject of a League of
Nations, having done so in his Nobel Peace Prize address.</p>

<p>The committee to represent at Paris the League to
Enforce Peace consisted of myself as chairman, Hamilton
Holt as vice-chairman, and such other members of the
League as might be in Paris at that time. Mr. Holt, after
consulting me as to methods and plan of action pending
my arrival, had left New York on December 28th. I had
postponed my departure for Paris until I could learn of my
son Roger's departure from Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>On January 25, 1919, I left New York, reaching London
on February 4th, where I promptly conferred with the
members of the British League of Nations Union. Sir
Willoughby Dickinson, M.P., gave me full details of the
meetings that had been held by the English, French, and
Italian leagues in Paris, at which our League was represented
by Hamilton Holt. I also had a consultation with
Lord Shaw, the chairman of the conference of delegates,
who gave me a copy of the resolutions that had been
adopted.</p>

<p>We remained in London several days, and while there
dined with our new ambassador, John W. Davis, formerly
the Solicitor-General of the United States. Both he
and Mrs. Davis, in the short time they had been in London,
had won the esteem of official England. At this dinner
I had a long conversation with the new Lord Chancellor,
Birkenhead, formerly Sir Frederick Smith, who held
a distinguished position at the British Bar, and had been
Attorney-General in the last Cabinet. In the latter part
of 1917 he had visited the United States, where I had met
him, and where he had made a number of addresses in the
leading cities, as well as in Canada. He was then only
forty-seven years of age, but looked much younger, and
therefore quite unlike the typical Lord Chancellor robed
in venerable dignity. He told me that he was the youngest
Lord Chancellor, with one exception, that had ever sat on
the woolsack. He had the youthful and vivacious face of
a man in the thirties. He said that nothing would please
him more than, when he was no longer Lord Chancellor,
to practice law in America, but he said that precedent
would not permit a former Lord Chancellor to return to
the bar and practice his profession.</p>

<p>Birkenhead was very outspoken in his opposition to a
League of Nations, saying that it was a Utopian idea. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
asked whether I had seen his book which had recently
appeared, describing his visit to America. I told him I
had not, and on the next day he sent me a copy bearing
his inscription.</p>

<p>The following day we lunched with Mr. and Mrs. Herbert
Samuel. He had held several Cabinet positions, and
had been Secretary of the Home Office in the last Cabinet.
He was defeated as candidate for Parliament in the
last election. He told me he had recently returned from
Paris from a Zionist Conference where his views and
advice were desired. He stated that he was not a Zionist,
but was in full sympathy with the Balfour Declaration to
secure a homeland in Palestine with equal civil and religious
rights for all nationalities. I told him that was
precisely my position. His son was present, who was
about twenty years of age, and had been in the British
army, and was later transferred to the Zionist Corps.</p>

<p>That evening I dined with Sir Arthur Steele-Maitland,
M.P., Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, where I
met my old friend Viscount Bryce, who was then about
eighty-two years of age. He was still in the best of
health and his mind was as alert as ever. He brought me
a copy of his recent brochure, "Proposals for the Prevention
of Future Wars," Maitland strongly favored a
League of Nations, and told me that after I arrived in
Paris, if I found it necessary for the committee of the
League of Nations Union to return there to reënforce the
official delegates, I should write or wire him, and several
of the members would go over to coöperate with our
committee; and that he would write Lord Robert Cecil
so that we might have a conference. I had similar letters
from Lord Shaw and Sir Willoughby Dickinson.</p>

<p>We arrived in Paris on February 9th, where our friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Mamelsdorf, had generously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
placed at our disposal their comfortable apartment in the
rue Montaigne, which was most conveniently and centrally
situated, and saved us the necessity and difficulty
of securing accommodations, all the hotels being jammed
full. The following morning I met Mr. Holt, who had
admirably represented our committee at the several
conferences that were held prior to my arrival; also
Judge William H. Wadhams, Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews,
Arthur Kuhn, secretary and legal adviser of our committee,
besides several other members of our League.</p>

<p>With Mr. Holt I went to the Crillon Hotel, headquarters
of the American Delegation, and had a conference
with Colonel House, with whom arrangements were made
for the fullest coöperation between our League and the
Official Commission. We also conferred with Mr. Gordon
Auchincloss, the son-in-law and secretary of Colonel
House, who, after consulting with the latter, gave me in
confidence a typewritten copy of the Articles of the
League entitled: "Draft as Provisionally Approved."
He said that the Colonel wanted me to have this, so that
I might study it. I was told at the same time that the
outlook for the adoption of a League was very discouraging
because the French Delegation, of which Léon Bourgeois
was the head, insisted upon the inclusion of two
additional clauses, (1) the control by the League of the
manufacture of all armaments and of all war industries,
and (2) an international military force to defend the
French frontier, which, Bourgeois insisted, quoting from
a former speech of President Wilson, "was the frontier of
civilization."</p>

<p>President Wilson had emphatically objected to the
proposed additions.</p>

<p>When I informed Colonel House that I was about to
call on Léon Bourgeois at his home across the Seine, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
said, "By all means, go," and added that Bourgeois's
attitude "had put the League on the rocks."</p>

<p>Mr. Holt, Mr. Kuhn, and I proceeded to Bourgeois's
house, but when we arrived there late in the afternoon,
we were told that M. Bourgeois was out, that he was then
in the Senate and would not return until late. While
there, however, I met my friend and colleague on the
Hague Tribunal, Baron d'Estournelles de Constant. He
said he would see to it that we met Bourgeois that evening.
Mr. Holt, Mr. Kuhn, and I then returned to my
apartment, and had hardly arrived there when my telephone
rang and I was informed that M. Bourgeois and
Baron d'Estournelles were on their way to my residence.
They arrived promptly at seven o'clock.</p>

<p>In the course of the discussion, Bourgeois presented the
interposing difficulties to which I have referred, giving
the divergence of views between him and President
Wilson and Colonel House. I explained to him, more fully
than he seemed to have appreciated before, that the war-making
power was lodged by our Constitution exclusively
in Congress, and that even if the President should agree
to the additional articles, if these articles would in any
way conflict with the war-making power as provided for
in the Constitution, President Wilson's assent would be
without effect, and would never be ratified by our Senate.</p>

<p>At this point in our conversation, the telephone rang
and M. Bourgeois was informed that the President of the
Ministry, M. Clemenceau, desired to see him at once.
Bourgeois said he would shortly return and hurriedly left
us. In the meantime we continued the conversation with
d'Estournelles, who, being familiar with our American
system, was better able to appreciate the problem. I
told him plainly that Colonel House had said to me that
afternoon that "the League of Nations was on the rocks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>Bourgeois returned in half an hour and we resumed the
discussion. After explaining more at length our constitutional
provisions, I told him that if the proposed League
were made too strong it would be useless, so far as America
was concerned, since it would not be ratified by the
Senate. Knowing what a strong advocate he had always
been of the League of Nations, as he was and had been for
years past the president of the French League of Nations
Society, I asked him whether he would prefer having no
League rather than a League as drafted, without the two
articles he had proposed.</p>

<p>He frankly replied that if that were the alternative, he
would prefer to have the League as drafted. He then
referred to the fact that at our last Congressional election,
the Administration had been defeated, and therefore, as
he understood it, the President represented a minority
party. I told him that, while such would be the case under
the European system, it was not so under our system,
and then read to him from my letter of credence "to support
the President," explaining that the president of our
League, Mr. Taft, along with Dr. Lowell, myself, and
many others, was not of the President's party, yet I was
authorized and instructed to support the President.</p>

<p>Bourgeois replied that at the Plenary Session of the
Conference, which was to be held on the Friday following,
namely, on the 14th, at the Quai d'Orsay, in view of the
American position which I had made clear to him, he
would support the "Draft as Provisionally Approved,"
but that he wanted me to appreciate that they had politics
in France as well as we had, and that therefore he
would, at any rate, have to present at the Conference the
two articles referred to, if for no other reason than for
their popular effect; but that I could rely on it that his
Government would in the final analysis accept the covenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
or draft as provisionally presented by the representatives
of the fourteen nations which had participated in
its preparation and had preliminarily agreed to it.</p>

<p>When Bourgeois and d'Estournelles departed, which
was at about ten o'clock, I called up Colonel House, and,
after briefly informing him what had taken place, I told
him that the League was "off the rocks." He expressed
his great gratification, and on the following morning when
I met him he said that he had informed the President,
who desired heartily to congratulate me.</p>

<p>When Colonel House had informed me that "the
League was on the rocks," it was more real than figurative;
for at the session of the Commission on the League
held the evening before, the French members having insisted
among other provisions upon an international army
to guard the frontier, and President Wilson having point-blank
refused to agree to it, an <i>impasse</i> had been reached,
since neither side would give way. The Commission thereupon
adjourned, apparently without any possibility of
coming to an understanding. Considerable bitterness was
developed in the discussion, as I learned, between the
President and M. Bourgeois. It was at this stage that
I fortuitously arrived at the Crillon to report that our
committee, by calling on M. Bourgeois, had been able
unofficially to take up and discuss with him the situation,
which officially had apparently passed beyond the
stage of further discussion. Therefore it was, as Holt
and I were subsequently informed, a great relief to the
President and Colonel House, as well as to Clemenceau
and Bourgeois, that we had been able to remove the <i>impasse</i>
by inducing the French delegates to agree to support
the Covenant as preliminarily drafted.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some months before, there had been organized in Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
a luncheon club, the Cercle Interallié, as a comfortable
and convenient meeting-place for many officials and
others. Immediately upon my arrival, I was introduced
at the club, where I frequently took lunch and met many
people, officials and delegates of the allied nations. The
day following our conversation at my apartment, I met
Baron d'Estournelles by appointment at lunch, and he
informed me that Bourgeois had expressed himself
gratified with the clarification I had given him and that
I could rely upon the Covenant being adopted as we had
agreed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th, while I was at Colonel
House's office, I received a copy of the Covenant which
had just been put in print, as reëdited by the Sub-Committee
of the League of Nations under the chairmanship
of Lord Robert Cecil. While I was there, President
Wilson came in to meet the representatives of the American
press. When he saw me, he expressed his high appreciation
for our services and helpfulness. The President
made a brief address to the correspondents, beginning in
a semi-humorous vein, and then giving a general description
of the Covenant as finally drafted, explaining that
where so many nations were involved, no one's individual
ideas could be fully satisfied, and that there had to be
yielding on all sides. Wilson added that he would have
liked to see some definite declaration regarding the protection
of religious minorities, and referred to several of
the other outstanding provisions.</p>

<p>Colonel House asked me to see Bourgeois again before
the Plenary Session which was to take place that afternoon,
saying that he had heard that Bourgeois was going
to oppose the Covenant. I immediately called on Bourgeois
again, and told him precisely what the Colonel had
said, but Bourgeois assured me that there had been no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
change, and that the Covenant, or as it was styled in
French, <i>Le Pacte</i>, would not be opposed.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, I went with former Ambassador
Henry White, one of our official delegates, to the Session
of the Plenary Conference at the Quai d'Orsay which
convened at 3.30 o'clock. I accompanied him into the
Conference room, a large, vaulted, ornate chamber known
as the Clock Room, where were seated, at the tables arranged
along three sides of a square, with an inner row
of seats arranged in the same way, the delegates of the
thirty nations.</p>

<p>On the outside of the square were the tables for the
secretaries of the several nations. At the head of the table
sat M. Clemenceau; to his right was President Wilson,
and on his left was to be Lloyd George, but as he was not
present, Lord Robert Cecil sat in his place. Next on the
right was Mr. Lansing, and next on the left was Mr. Balfour,
and so on in order. In the rear of the chamber were
a number of distinguished persons and other officials of
the Powers. To one side was another large room with
arched entrances, occupied by the correspondents of the
press of the world. The proceedings began at four
o'clock. The ushers closed the large entrance doors leading
out into the foyer, and all was still and in expectancy
when Clemenceau rose and, in his usual brusque and
unceremonious manner, announced that "Monsieur
Wilson" would have the "parole," meaning the floor.</p>

<p>President Wilson arose, calm, dignified, and entirely
self-possessed, and, after a few preliminary words, stated
that the representatives of the fourteen nations which
composed the League of Nations Committee had unanimously
agreed to the Covenant consisting of twenty-six
articles to be presented to the Conference, representing,
according to the estimate, 1,200,000,000 people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>He read the articles of the Covenant, one by one, interpolating
here and there brief explanations. The title
"Covenant" had been given the document by Wilson, a
designation he had previously used in one of his speeches.
This was regarded as most appropriate, since the pact
was not a treaty or convention, but something higher and
more sacred, hence the scriptural designation "Covenant,"
such as God had made with Israel.</p>

<p>After reading the articles, Wilson made an address of
about thirty minutes. It was clear, forceful, and in his
inimitable style. In closing he said: "Armed force is in
the background in this programme, but it is in the background,
and if the moral force of the world will not suffice,
the physical force of the world shall. But that is the
last resort, because this is intended as a constitution of
peace, not as a League of War. Many terrible things
have come out of this war, gentlemen, but some very
beautiful things have come out of it. Wrong has been
defeated, but the rest of the world has been more conscious
than it ever was before, of the majesty of right."</p>

<p>Lord Robert Cecil then spoke briefly, and I will quote
a single passage from his address: "Finally, we have
thought that if the world is to be at peace, it is not enough
to forbid war. We must do something more than that. We
must try and substitute for the principle of international
competition that of international coöperation."</p>

<p>Signor Orlando of Italy followed with a brief address,
then M. Léon Bourgeois rose and spoke somewhat at
length in French. He said that he proposed amendments
which he thought he ought to mention; that while his
country had accepted the text which had been read, the
amendments were mentioned so that, as the text went
before the world, the amendments might also be considered,
to the effect that we ought to have a permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
organization to prepare military and naval means of
execution and make them ready in case of emergency.</p>

<p>Baron Makino, speaking with persuasive eloquence in
perfect English, maintained his previous amendments
which were as follows: "The equality of nations being a
basic principle of the League of Nations, the High Contracting
Parties agree to accord, as soon as possible, to all
aliens, nationals of States, members of the League, equal
and just treatment in every respect, making no distinction
either in law or in fact on account of their race or
nationality." He then added: "I feel it my duty to declare
clearly on this occasion that the Japanese Government
and people feel poignant regret at the failure of the
Commission to approve of their just demand for laying
down a principle aiming at the adjustment of this long-standing
grievance, the demand that is based upon a
deep-rooted natural conviction. They will continue in
their insistence for the adoption of this principle by the
League in the future."</p>

<p>George Barnes, the English labor leader, then spoke,
upholding the argument of Bourgeois for an international
force. After him Venizelos spoke, referring to the amendments
of France which had been held back because of
constitutional barriers of acquiescence on the part of certain
countries. He thought those countries should make
an effort to remove those barriers, but that, if they could
not do so, then France should recede from her position.
Mr. Hughes of Australia interposed a question, demanding
to know when and where the discussion of mandatories
would take place, to which Clemenceau replied that the
document would rest on the table and would be discussed
at a distant date. Thereupon, he abruptly adjourned the
session.</p>

<p>As the delegates moved out, I met President Wilson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
who asked me for my opinion about the Covenant. I
replied that it was much more comprehensive and forceful
than I had believed it possible for the nations preliminarily
to agree upon. He expressed himself as much
gratified. I believed then, and do yet, that but for Wilson's
prestige and dominant leadership of the Conference,
so far at least as the Covenant was concerned, it
would perhaps not have been formulated, if ever, until
after the Treaty of Peace was concluded. At any rate, I
very much doubt if an agreement could have been
arrived at.</p>

<p>After my conversation with Wilson, Bourgeois said to
me that he hoped I was satisfied with his remarks in support
of the Covenant, that he had to refer to the amendments
he presented so that they might receive consideration.
I told him that he had followed the course he had
agreed to when he spoke to me two nights before, that
while he would refer to his amendments, he would nevertheless
support the Covenant.</p>

<p>When I had returned to my apartment, I wrote in my
"Random Notes": "I regard this day and its happenings
as the golden chapter in the history of civilization."
Notwithstanding what has since happened, I have not
abandoned hope that such may yet prove true.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Two days before the meeting of the Conference, Hamilton
Holt and I had tea with General Smuts, the distinguished
South African delegate. He is a man of very
pleasant appearance, rather short in stature, and with his
florid complexion looks like a veritable Dutchman. He
was then apparently about fifty years of age. He would
hardly, from his appearance, be taken for a soldier, but
rather for a student. He had given much detailed study
to the subject of a League of Nations, and from his brochure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
"The League of Nations&mdash;A Practical Suggestion"
(1918) more of his suggestions as there set forth entered
into the articles of the Covenant than those proposed
by any other of the delegates, including Wilson. Smuts
advocated in this brochure that "the League should be
put in the very forefront of the programme of the Peace
Conference," the same position that Wilson afterward
successfully pushed forward. In the preface of his brochure,
dated December 16, 1918, Smuts says:</p>

<blockquote><p>To my mind the world is ripe for the greatest step forward
ever made in the government of man. And I hope this brief
account of the League will assist the public to realize how great
an advance is possible to-day as a direct result of the immeasurable
sacrifices of this war. If that advance is not made,
this war will, from the most essential point of view, have been
fought in vain, and great calamities will follow.</p></blockquote>

<p>Several days after the Conference, on February 17th,
my wife and I, Mr. and Mrs. Holt, and Arthur Kuhn of
our committee, attended the French Senate with Baron
d'Estournelles, who is a member thereof. He introduced
us to a number of Senators, with whom we had tea. I had
a talk with the venerable Alexandre Ribot, head of the
group of the Moderate Republican Party, a refined gentleman
of the old school, and of thoroughly statesmanlike
appearance. We also met Senator Paul Strauss, whom I
had known when he and his wife visited our country some
eighteen years before. He is the editor of the "Revue
Philanthropique," and is a member of the Academy of
Medicine. He said that he believed his family and mine
were connected. This may be so, but I have no definite
record.</p>

<p>Dining with Sir Robert Borden, then Premier of Canada
and one of the British delegates, the following evening,
we met several of his colleagues. Balfour was expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
but he had been compelled to return to London
that day. Sir Robert was an important member of the
British Delegation and made some very helpful suggestions.
He opposed Article X of the Covenant which
provides that "the High Contracting Parties undertake
to respect and preserve as against external aggression the
territorial integrity and existing political independence of
all States, members of the League," etc., the same article
that eventually met with so much opposition in our Senate,
and doubtless was the principal cause for the Senate's
failure to ratify. At that time it was generally rumored
that Borden would be selected as ambassador to the
United States to succeed Lord Reading. He would
doubtless have made a most acceptable representative
in Washington of the British Government, exceptional
as it would have been to have the British Empire represented
by a colonial official. No one could have been sent
who understood our country and our people better.</p>

<p>Washington's Birthday was celebrated by the American
Society, which gave a luncheon at the Hôtel Quai d'Orsay,
which I attended. There were present about one hundred
and fifty Americans. It was a notable assembly, and I
had the pleasure of sitting next to General Pershing, with
whom I had a lengthy talk. We spoke, among other
things, of the proposal that our country should take a
mandate to govern the Ottoman Empire or any part of
Europe. Great propaganda had been made that we
should take a mandate for the Ottoman Empire. Pershing
agreed with me that this would lead to endless complications
and would not be approved at home. I also
talked with Colonel House upon the subject, who was of
the same opinion. Pershing was evidently quite nervous,
for he was expected to speak, and he was making some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
notes. It appeared to me he was more disturbed than if he
were about to enter into a serious military engagement.</p>

<p>I had lunch the next day with Boris Bakhmeteff, the
Russian ambassador to the United States, at which I met
Sazonoff, former Minister for Foreign Affairs under the
Czar's régime. We naturally spoke about affairs in Russia
and the possibility of reconstruction. I was told that the
late Czar was kindly and humane, but that he had been
completely misled and dominated by crafty ministers who
were plotting and intriguing one against another; that
Russia was not, by reason of the ignorance of its people,
fitted to become a republic, but that it must have a government
powerfully centralized, and that its best hope
would be the restoration of the monarchy under Grand
Duke Nicholas as constitutional ruler. Sazonoff said it
was a pity that Petrograd was not taken by the Allied
fleet. I am told that, under the Czar, Sazonoff was the
leader of the liberal wing.</p>

<p>A few days later I gave a little dinner at my apartment
to enable Mr. Vance McCormick, chairman of the War
Trade Board, to meet several prominent Russians, including
Ambassador Bakhmeteff and Sazonoff. Mr.
Hoover was also present. We discussed the rehabilitation
of commerce with Russia.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February the Union of Associations for
the Society of Nations, together with the European
Bureau of the Carnegie Peace Foundation, gave a luncheon
in honor of Ambassador Sharp and myself at the
Cercle Interallié, at which M. Léon Bourgeois presided.
There were present some seventy-five guests, mostly
delegates and French officials, including Sir Robert
Borden; Venizelos, the Greek delegate; the Roumanian
minister; M. Vesnitch, the Serbian minister; and the
Brazilian ambassador. At the conclusion, M. Bourgeois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
arose, and, although there were to be no set speeches, he
expressed the regret of the French nation that Ambassador
Sharp would in the near future relinquish his post,
and complimented his Administration upon its work of
the past four trying years. He praised my effective helpfulness
in regard to the League of Nations, and stated
that he not only greeted me as a twin, because he was
born in the same year as I was, but also as a Frenchman,
since my father, who was born in 1809, was a Frenchman
by birth, and because my great-grandfather was a delegate
to the Conference which was summoned by Napoleon
during the first decade of the past century.</p>

<p>In reply, I stated that an American, to be truly patriotic,
should understand our early history, and that no
American with this knowledge could fail to have a love
and sense of gratitude for France, our ally in the establishment
of democracy, as we had so recently been her ally
for the liberation of the world.</p>

<p>My various conferences regarding the League of Nations,
while it was under discussion and formulation by
the Committee of the Conference having charge of that
subject, were held with Colonel House and his secretary,
Mr. Auchincloss. On February 27th, I had lunch with
Secretary Lansing. It had been quite obvious to me that
even before this he had been practically side-tracked,
and that Colonel House had replaced him from the beginning,
doubtless by direction of the President. This
was very evident so far as the League of Nations was
concerned. Mr. Lansing informed me that he had pointed
out a number of technical objections to the Covenant as
formulated, which, he was sure, would prove a fruitful
source of difference and would make trouble. It seemed
to me that he was evidently not conversant with the
various stages of discussion regarding the articles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Covenant. I referred to the entire omission in the second
draft of the section respecting civil and religious liberty
and the protection of minorities, which was contained in
the tentative draft, but was finally omitted because Japan
had insisted that the equality of races be included, whereupon
the whole subject had been omitted. I suggested
that the entire subject, which was in fact a Bill of Rights,
now that it had been excluded from the Covenant, should
be incorporated in the treaties to be made with each of
the new nations. Lansing agreed with me that that
should be done and would under the circumstances be the
best plan.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At this time, during February and March, 1919, the
League to Enforce Peace had organized numerous meetings
throughout the country from New York to San
Francisco, advocating a League of Nations. Mr. Taft
had spoken at many of these meetings for months past,
traveling untiringly and making most effective addresses.
At these meetings the Covenant was approved and resolutions
to that effect were passed. On February 25th and
28th I received cables briefly describing such meetings
and the substance of the resolutions passed. I received
cables to the same effect from Salt Lake City, from San
Francisco, and from New York. These I gave to Colonel
House, who in turn gave them to the press, and sometimes
they were cabled back through the Associated Press
to American newspapers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From time to time a number of the representatives of
the Balkan and East European nations came to my
apartment to confer with me, doubtless because of my
diplomatic experiences in that part of the world, and
because of my relationship with Colonel House and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
official Commission. Among others who conferred with
me was M. Venizelos, who came to discuss the claims of
Greece to additional territory to the north, and on the
western littoral of Asia Minor, and to the islands adjacent.
He explained, as an ethnological basis for such a claim,
that the Greek race was purer and less mixed in that part
of Asia Minor and in the islands than in Greece proper.
He placed before me several brochures containing studies
of these points and sent me maps illustrating those claims,
also a document in English entitled: "Greece Before the
Peace Congress." He told me that, unless his presence
was imperatively demanded in Paris, he would attend
with me the London Conference of the Peace Societies of
the various nations which was to be held there March
11th.</p>

<p>On March 7th M. Vesnitch, the chief delegate of Serbia,
came to see me about Serbia's claims to two towns,
Verschatz and Weisskirchen, which the sub-committee of
ten, under the chairmanship of M. Tardieu, had awarded
to Roumania. He claimed they were predominantly
Serbian as to sympathies and population, and that because
they happened to be on the railroad running
through Roumania was no valid reason for transferring
them under Roumanian sovereignty. He said Serbia
could never consent to such transfer, which would cause
not only dissatisfaction, but constant trouble.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The day after the Plenary Session of the Conference
and the preliminary adoption of the Covenant, President
Wilson returned to America. I talked with M. Bourgeois,
M. Vesnitch, M. Venizelos, and several of the chairmen
of the allied societies for a League of Nations, and we
agreed to hold a conference of the delegates of the various
societies. Chiefly because of our desire of having with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Sir Edward Grey, who was the chairman of the British Society,
and Lord Bryce, both of whom at that time were
not entirely well, we decided to hold the conference
in London instead of in Paris. It was subsequently decided
to hold it March 11th-13th for the purpose of discussing
the draft of the Covenant as preliminarily
adopted, and to consider such changes and amendments
as might be deemed advisable, which when acted upon
and adopted were to be presented to our respective official
delegates prior to the next meeting of the Plenary
Conference, to be held after President Wilson's return.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on March 11th, the delegates representing
America, Great Britain, France, Greece, China,
Jugo-Slavia, and Roumania assembled in London, in all
about fifty in number. Besides myself as chairman, there
attended, from America, Hamilton Holt, Arthur Kuhn,
Dr. Henry Churchill King, Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews,
Raymond V. Ingersoll, Dr. Frederick Lynch, and Edward
Harding. Great Britain was represented by Lord
Shaw of Dunfermline, Sir W. H. Dickinson, Major David
Davies, M.P.; J. H. Thomas, M.P.; J. R. Clynes,
M.P.; Sir A. Shirley Benn, M.P.; Sir Arthur Steele-Maitland,
M.P.; Professor Gilbert Murray; Aneurin
Williams, M.P.; H. Wickham Steed, and others. From
France came M. Léon Bourgeois, Vice-Admiral Fournier,
General Léon Durand, Baron d'Estournelles de Constant,
and others. Greece was represented by M. Venizelos and
Professor Andreades. China was represented by Mr.
Chang and Mr. Cheng; Jugo-Slavia by M. Yovanovitch;
and Roumania by Professor E. Pangrati, Professor
Negulesco, and Miss Helene Vacaresco.</p>

<p>A preliminary consultation was held on the 10th, with
Professor Gilbert Murray in the chair, and next morning
the first meeting of the conference was held at Caxton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
Hall, Westminster. Lord Shaw was elected chairman,
and W. J. T. Griffith, secretary. The various articles of
the Covenant were discussed, together with the amendments
and changes proposed by the delegates from the
several countries. On behalf of our delegation, I offered
a resolution regarding the free exercise of religion as well
as freedom from civil and political discrimination because
of religion, which resolution after discussion was
unanimously adopted. Nine separate resolutions were
offered by the British delegates, some ten resolutions by
the French delegates, and others by the Roumanian and
the Chinese delegates. In all, there were three sessions,
and the resolutions that were adopted M. Bourgeois
was authorized to present to the allied prime ministers.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 12th, Major David Davies, on
behalf of the League of Nations Union, gave a dinner at
the Criterion Restaurant to M. Bourgeois, Dr. Nansen,
M. Vandervelde, M. Venizelos, and me. Right Hon. H.
A. L. Fisher, Secretary for Education, was toastmaster.
Besides the delegates, a number of other prominent men
were present. Several speeches were made laudatory of
the Covenant and expressing high hopes for the new
world order. Emphasis was laid upon the necessity of
building up a body of opinion throughout the world to
support the ideals of the League and of international
peace.</p>

<p>After adjournment, I returned to Paris, and on March
24th made a report to President Wilson, who, a few days
before, had returned from America, and sent him the
resolution proposed by the American delegates, namely,
to add a new article to the Covenant as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>The High Contracting Parties, realizing that religious discriminations
give rise to internal dissatisfaction and unrest
which militate against international concord, agree to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
and maintain in their respective countries, as well as in states
and territories under the tutelage of other states acting as
mandatories on behalf of the League, the free exercise of religion
as well as freedom from civil and political discrimination
because of adherence to any creed, religion or belief not inconsistent
with public order or with public morals.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this proposal President Wilson replied, saying: "I
am indeed interested in a religious liberty article in the
Covenant, but am trying to reach the matter in another
way." He doubtless had in mind to cover it in treaties
with the new nations for the protection of minorities, as
was subsequently provided in the treaty with Poland and
with the Balkan States.</p>

<p>At a luncheon on April 6th with the Russian group of
refugee statesmen in Paris, I again met M. Sazonoff;
M. de Giers, formerly ambassador at Constantinople; M.
Bark, formerly Minister of Finance under the Government
of the late Czar; and M. Boris Bakhmeteff, the
Russian ambassador to the United States. They all spoke
most disparagingly of Russian conditions at the time.
M. Sazonoff criticized and complained of the Peace Conference,
which, as he stated, had in no way condemned
Russian Bolshevism, and its failure in so doing had encouraged
the Bolsheviki. He said that had the Allies
taken Petrograd, which could have been done with very
little sacrifice, that would have been the beginning of the
end of Bolshevism and would have rallied the Russian
people, who would themselves have destroyed the Bolsheviki.
He added that Russia's cruel treatment of the
Jews under the Czar's Government was an indefensible
wrong, and doubtless contributed to driving some of
those who had suffered most into the ranks of the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p>While Sazonoff was talking, I wondered why he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
some of his colleagues in the Ministry had not prevented
the outrages against defenseless Jews, which resulted in
the horrible pogroms which shocked the moral sensibility
of the world.</p>

<p>It is true that Sazonoff belonged to the so-called liberals
of Russia, and they did not have the courage to stand
up for the basic principles of humanity when in office,
which they now, doubtless, sincerely proclaim. Such is the
withering and dispiriting effect of autocratic government
upon its own highest officials, who often lack the courage,
even if they have the vision, to correct abuses; and because
of this moral cowardice they prepare the way and supply
the motive that sooner or later expresses itself in revolution.
Napoleon is reputed to have said that the treatment
of the Jews in every country is the thermometer of that
country's civilization.</p>

<p>Several times a week, during this period, conferences
occurred in my apartment with representatives of the
Eastern and Balkan States. Information had reached
Paris that serious persecution of Jews was threatened in
Prague and throughout Tchecko-Slovakia; and on March
25th a conference was arranged between M. Edouard
Benès, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Tchecko-Slovak
Republic, and several gentlemen representing the
American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish
and Zionist Committee, consisting of Julian W. Mack,
Judge of the United States Circuit Court; Professor Felix
Frankfurter, of Harvard University; Aaron Aaronson,
head of the Agricultural Experiment Station of Palestine;
Lewis L. Strauss, the assistant of Herbert Hoover; and
myself. Letters from Prague from two of the Food Administration
officials reported that a press propaganda
was carried on against Jews, and that several attacks
upon them had been made; that a movement was on foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
to deport a number of them to Pressburg, the hot-bed of
Bolshevism.</p>

<p>M. Benès pointed out that if any pogroms occurred,
which these reports foreshadowed, it would seriously
prejudice his country and would alienate American sympathy,
which in turn might result in discontinuing food
shipments to his country. He stated that he was a disciple
of President Masaryk and always shared his liberal
social and political views; he said he would at once telegraph
President Masaryk, who he knew would do everything
in his power to suppress the anti-Semitic agitation.
We were very much impressed with the enlightened
statesmanship of M. Benès, who, since then, has shown
himself to be one of the foremost statesmen in middle
Europe. He assured us at the time that any persecution
of minorities in his country would be contrary to its
organic laws, and in direct violation of the principles and
policies upon which it had been determined to organize
the State, and that we could rely on it that no efforts
would be spared in securing equal justice for all without
regard to race or religion.</p>

<p>From Sir Robert L. Borden, the Premier of Canada
and one of the delegates of the British Empire to the
Peace Conference, I received on March 21st a copy of his
memorandum on the several articles of the Covenant.
I found them well conceived and in the main admirable.
He opposed Article X as drafted. He wanted it either
stricken out or clarified. I sent him a copy of a speech of
Mr. Taft's of March 5th referring to the same subject.</p>

<p>At the request of Colonel House, on April 11th, I had
another conference with M. Bourgeois. The Commission
on the League of Nations of the fourteen nations, under
the chairmanship of President Wilson, had the night before
held a protracted session discussing the revision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the Covenant, at which President Wilson offered the revised
Article XXI containing the special provision regarding
the Monroe Doctrine, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article XXI</span></p>

<p>Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity
of international engagements such as treaties of arbitration
or regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine for securing
the maintenance of peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Larnaud and M. Bourgeois, the French representatives,
both objected to specific reference to the Monroe
Doctrine, and made long speeches in support of such
objection. Colonel House desired me to impress upon M.
Bourgeois the reasons for this amendment and why it was
necessary specifically to mention the Monroe Doctrine,
because, without it, it would not be possible to have the
Covenant confirmed by the Senate. As I did not know
M. Larnaud, I thought it best to discuss the subject with
M. Bourgeois so that he might confer with his colleague.
In company with Baron d'Estournelles de Constant, I
called on M. Bourgeois at his residence. I soon learned
that M. Bourgeois did not object to specific reference to
the Monroe Doctrine, but he desired, in return for his
assent, to obtain President Wilson's assent to the amendments
Bourgeois had offered respecting a general staff
and control or supervision of the military force that each
of the States was to supply to support the League. As the
Commission was to meet again to finish the consideration
of the Covenant, he agreed to confer with M. Clemenceau,
saying he would have to learn the other's views. He
further said it must be determined how best to formulate
the article especially referring to the Monroe Doctrine so
as not to conflict with the general provisions.</p>

<p>At the session of the Commission that evening at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Crillon Hotel, which lasted until after midnight, the
article as quoted above, specifically mentioning the Monroe
Doctrine, was adopted. Colonel House gave me the
exact wording of the article, which I at once cabled to the
League to Enforce Peace in New York, with the request
that Mr. Taft be informed. The same day I received a
cable from Mr. Taft and Dr. Lowell, forwarded by Acting
Secretary of State Frank L. Polk, to the effect that, in the
opinion of the Executive Committee of the League, specific
reference to the exclusion of the Monroe Doctrine
from the jurisdiction of the Covenant of the League was
absolutely necessary to secure confirmation by the Senate.
On the following day Taft cabled me that the Monroe
Doctrine amendment was "eminently satisfactory."</p>

<p>I immediately advised President Wilson, sending him
a copy of the cable. The following day, I received the
following letter from him:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

18 <i>April</i>, 1919
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I have been very much cheered by your kind letter of yesterday,
with the message which it quotes from the League to Enforce
Peace and from Mr. Taft personally, and I want to thank
you very warmly for your own kind personal assurances of
satisfaction with the results of our work on the Covenant.</p>

<div class="signature">
Cordially and sincerely yours<br />
<span class="smcap">Woodrow Wilson</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>On April 23d, on the invitation of Professor Stephen
Hayes Bush, of the State University of Iowa, who was in
charge of the Free Lecture Course of the American Expeditionary
Force, I delivered an address in the Grand
Amphitheatre of the Sorbonne. The great hall was filled
with about one thousand of our officers and men who were
taking courses at this ancient institution of learning.
There were two lectures that afternoon, the other by
M. Ferdinand Buisson, the noted educator. His subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
was "The Educational System of France," which he had
done so much to develop since the educational system had
been secularized by the separation of Church and State
in France. He described why education had been taken
from the control of the Catholic clergy, not out of hostility
to the Church, but in order not to prejudice the
religious scruples of non-clericals and non-Catholics.</p>

<p>I took as my subject "America and the League of
Nations," and showed in what respect the Covenant provided
definite sanctions to make peace decisions effective.
I pointed out that following the war, for the first
time in history, the dominant power of the world rested in
democratically governed nations, and that theirs was the
opportunity and the responsibility to make provisions
that such a war shall never be waged again; and that now
it was the duty of statesmanship to translate the victory
won in war into greater security for the future peace and
happiness of the world. I quoted from the speech of
President Poincaré in welcoming the Peace Delegates,
in which he had described the reasons why America entered
the World War. He had said: "It was a supreme
judgment passed at the bar of history by the lofty conscience
of a free people to rescue her mother from the
humiliation of thralldom and to save civilization."</p>

<p>That same evening, M. Nicolas W. Tchaikovsky, president
of the Archangel Government of Northern Russia,
called at my apartment to discuss with me conditions in
Russia. I had met him before when he was in Washington
in 1907, after his escape from prison in Siberia. During
several periods before that time he had lived in
western United States, where he had engaged in farming.
He had formerly belonged to the group of social revolutionists.
I spoke with him about the Hoover plan of
sending food into Russia, to which he replied that if an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
armed force could be sent there it would be better, but
that without an armed force the Bolsheviki would use the
provisions for their own red guard. I explained to him
that that could not be done, since the agents of the Food
Administration would themselves supervise the distribution,
just as was done in Belgium during the German occupation.
He did not seem to think well of the whole
plan and considered that it would be of advantage to the
Bolsheviki politically, and would make their people believe
it was a recognition of their régime. He seemed to think
that the Bolsheviki authorities could not stop fighting in
Russia even if they wanted to, as their several generals
acted independently.</p>

<p>He spoke of Lenin as an honest, strong-headed, misguided
fanatic, who he believed would in time discover
his error and would have the moral courage and honesty
to throw up his hands. Trotsky, he said, was quite another
sort&mdash;an ambitious adventurer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Plenary Session of the Conference was called to
order at the Quai d'Orsay on April 28th, at 3 <span class="smcap"><small>P.M.</small></span> I again
attended with our official delegate, former Ambassador
Henry White. The representatives of the thirty nations
were seated as before. I was given a seat just behind the
American Commission. The Session was presided over
by M. Clemenceau, who showed no signs of the effects of
his recent wound by an assassin's bullet. He opened the
session with a few words, then called on President Wilson,
who declared in a matter-of-fact way that, since he had
read the articles of the Covenant to the Conference at
the previous session (February 14th), and since all the
delegates had the Covenant as amended before them,
he would confine himself to pointing out the amendments
and the reasons therefor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>The immense hall was packed as on previous occasions.
After President Wilson had made his statement, which
was rendered into French by the official interpreter, he
moved several resolutions, one nominating Sir James
Eric Drummond as Secretary-General of the League, and
one that Belgium, Brazil, Greece, and Spain should be
members of the Council pending the selection of the four
additional States by the Assembly of the League.</p>

<p>As chairman of the League to Enforce Peace, I wrote
a letter to the President on the following day offering my
congratulations upon the adoption of the Covenant. To
this I received the following reply:</p>

<blockquote><div class="signature">

<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, 1 <i>May,</i> 1919
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Straus</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Thank you with all my heart for your generous letter of the
29th. It has given me the greatest pleasure and encouragement,
and I want to take the opportunity to say how valuable in
every way your own support of and enthusiasm for the League
of Nations has been. It is a real pleasure to receive your unqualified
approbation.</p>

<div class="signature">
Cordially and sincerely yours<br />
<span class="smcap">Woodrow Wilson</span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>After the Plenary Session on April 28th and the adoption
of the Covenant of the League of Nations, I felt that
my duties in Paris were at an end. The winter had been
very strenuous, and the weather had been very inclement&mdash;much
rain and very little sunshine. I decided to
take a rest, and was advised, because of some slight ailment
in my left leg due to impeded circulation, to take
the baths at Bagnoles de l'Orne. The usual régime there
is to take twenty-one baths. After I had taken eight, I
received a letter from Colonel House saying that he would
regard it most helpful if I would return to America at as
early a date as possible. He informed me that the counsel
for the American Commission, David Hunter Miller, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
also returning; that passage had been secured for both of
us on the U.S.S. Mount Vernon which was sailing from
Brest on June 2d. He stated that it would be rendering a
valuable service if I would confer with some of the Senators,
so that they might be fully informed regarding the
discussions and details of the negotiations as they progressed.</p>

<p>I accordingly returned to Paris, and on May 27th had
a conference with Colonel House, who again impressed
upon me the services I might render in returning to the
United States, since no one was more familiar than Mr.
Miller and I with the meaning and significance of the
articles of the Covenant; no one, therefore, was better
qualified to answer the criticisms and objections that
had been made.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, he said that in his opinion
Woodrow Wilson would not become a candidate again
for President unless the treaty were rejected, which might
force him to run against his will in order to save the treaty;
should the treaty, however, be ratified, there would be
no occasion for him to become a candidate.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The day before this, while I was paying a visit at the
Hotel Continental, I met Jane Addams and Lillian Wald,
and with them was Alexander Kerensky, the former
Premier of Russia, They asked me to meet Kerensky,
which I did. He proved to be not at all the kind of man in
appearance that I had pictured. He did not resemble the
Russian type. He was clean-shaven, rather spare, a little
above medium height, and seemed about forty years of
age. He looked more like a student than like a leader who
had stood in the storm-center of political turmoil.</p>

<p>Kerensky told me that he did not believe in Kolschak,
principally because he regarded him as a tool of the Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
and Russian nobility. Kerensky expressed himself
as opposed to having the Allies recognize Kolschak unless
it was conditioned on definite guarantees that a free
democratic election be held so that the people might
decide what form of government they desired.</p>

<p>The following day, Dr. Dluski, the Polish peace delegate,
together with M. Lieberman, a Jewish member of
the Polish Diet, called upon me to explain, if not justify,
the Polish pogroms, evidently because of the great publicity
that had been given thereto by the mass meeting in
New York. The resolutions passed by that meeting, and
presented to the President, had appeared in dispatches to
European papers.</p>

<p>We left Paris for Brest on May 30th. The Mount
Vernon, which was scheduled to sail on the following day,
had postponed sailing until June 3d. It carried some
five thousand officers and men of the Sixth Division. Dr.
Mezes and his wife were also on board. Dr. Mezes, who
is a brother-in-law of Colonel House, organized the group
of experts, of which he was chairman, which had rendered
such valuable service to the Commission. We were
all very comfortably provided for on the ship, and it was
most interesting to observe the system and order with
which the five thousand officers and men were taken
care of. They were a jolly lot, happy to return home, and
without exception conducted themselves in a correct and
orderly manner. We had a delightful crossing; the
weather was fine and the sea was calm.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Shortly after my return to the United States, the
League to Enforce Peace called a meeting of the Executive
Council to determine what action it could best take to
further the ratification of the treaty which was now being
vigorously debated in the Senate. It was decided that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Mr. Vance McCormick and I should be a committee to
confer with the President. We subsequently desired to
add Dr. A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard University,
to our number, provided it would be agreeable to
the President, which Mr. McCormick was to ascertain
when arranging for the appointment. The President
designated August 6th as the day on which he would see
us, and accordingly Dr. Lowell, Mr. McCormick, the
Secretary of the League, Dr. Short, and I went to the
White House.</p>

<p>President Wilson assured us that, while he was somewhat
tired, he felt in good condition. He said he had had
a number of conferences with individual Senators who
had objected to the ratification of the treaty, and that he
had given them explanations regarding the main points
in dispute, namely, Article X, guaranteeing against external
aggression; Article XXI, providing that nothing in
the Covenant should be deemed to affect the validity of
the Monroe Doctrine; and Article I, providing that any
member of the League may, after two years' notice, withdraw
from the League. These were the main subjects
covered by the reservations formulated by the moderate
group headed by Senators Kellogg and McCumber.</p>

<p>We suggested that it might be of good result if the
President could in some public and formal way make his
explanations and interpretations regarding these points.
The question was how this could best be done. The
President believed it would be preferable if one of the
Senators of the opposition addressed to him a letter of
inquiry, so framed as to enable the President to give his
views. It was then understood that Dr. Lowell, Mr. McCormick,
and I should confer with Senator Hitchcock,
the Democratic leader of the minority of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, who could advise us as to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
member of the Republican majority on the committee it
would be best for us to confer with.</p>

<p>After our conference with the President, we went to the
Senate and found the Committee on Foreign Relations in
session, examining Secretary of State Lansing. Senator
Hitchcock suggested that we call on Senator McCumber,
but as he was not then in Washington, Dr. Lowell and
I called on Senator Kellogg. The latter told us what we
already knew, namely, that he was in favor of the League
and was scheduled to make his speech in the Senate advocating
the ratification of the treaty with the reservations
his group had formulated, which reservations he
felt confident were not in the nature of amendments, but
interpretative only, and therefore would not require resubmission
either to the Plenary Session or to Germany.
Dr. Lowell and I outlined our plan regarding the letter
to the President, asking for his interpretation of the articles
above referred to. While Senator Kellogg personally
favored this plan, he said he would first have to confer
with the members of his group, and he believed they
would be favorably inclined. We then inquired whether
the President's interpretations and clarifications might
not serve the purpose of making the reservations unnecessary.
The Senator said "no," but that the reservations
could recite the fact that they were based upon the
President's interpretations. We arranged that Senators
Kellogg and Hitchcock should confer upon the subject
with a view of preparing such a tentative letter of inquiry
which might be shown to the President in advance, and
to which the President could reply, giving his interpretations.</p>

<p>After leaving Senator Kellogg, we again called on
Senator Hitchcock. In all of these conferences between
the Senators of the various groups, we acted as the "honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
brokers" for the League. Senator Hitchcock thought
very favorably of our plan and believed it would work
out advantageously. Dr. Lowell and I felt gratified with
our day's work, though, as matters developed, nothing
came of this plan.</p>

<p>In this connection I cannot refrain from quoting a story
which Dr. Lowell told apropos of the problem. The story,
as I recall it, was that a noted colored preacher was holding
a service in which he read a chapter from Isaiah referring
to the Seraphim. After the service one of the colored
brethren asked the preacher what was "the difference between
a Seraphim and a terrapin." The latter, rubbing his
head, replied: "My son, I grant you there is a difference,
but they have made it up."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while there was, in words at least, if not
in context, a difference between the reservations offered
by the Administration group, the group of mild reservationists,
and the majority group, yet, for reasons that I
need not enter into here, they did not "make it up."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In concluding this chapter and in closing these memoirs,
I cannot resist reflecting how much wiser the Allied
Powers and America were in the conduct of the war than
in the making of peace, and afterwards. In war they
finally pooled their strength and won; in the peace terms
they again drew measurably apart. The men who framed
the peace terms subordinated world policies to home politics.
The United States, by reason of a contest between
the Administration and the majority group in the Senate,
allowed its sense of world responsibility to be negated
by partisan differences. Reconstruction is being halted.
And why? Because the leading statesmen of the Entente
Powers still lack the economic wisdom, or, what is the
equivalent, the courage, to shape their international policies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
along world economic lines. My own country, in
withholding its coöperation, is equally culpable. The result
is tension and derangement in the relationship of
nations.</p>

<p>As the malady from which this and other countries are
suffering is world-wide, so must the remedy be world-wide.
And America cannot free herself from the responsibility
by isolating herself and refusing to do her part in
applying the remedial measures necessary to restore normal
conditions. The remedy does not consist in the lessening
or weakening of sovereignty by individual states.
It consists in the enlargement of their sovereign functions
in concert with and in just relations to other states for
the administration of common interests. It requires no
surrender of sovereignty for individual states to conform
their policies to the world's common needs.</p>

that in the sub-committee one of the German delegates, Professor Zorn of
Königsberg, who had become very earnest in behalf of arbitration, now says
that he may not be able to vote for it. There are also signs that the German
Emperor is influencing the minds of his allies, the sovereigns of Austria, Italy,
Turkey, and Roumania, leading them to oppose it." (<i>Autobiography of Andrew

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
